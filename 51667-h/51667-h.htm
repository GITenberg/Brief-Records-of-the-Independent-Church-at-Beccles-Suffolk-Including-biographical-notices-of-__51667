<h2><a name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
v</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> months ago, I was favoured
with a perusal of the earliest records of the Independent church
at Beccles.&nbsp; An interest in the subject once excited, I went
on to collect such other materials for its history as fell in my
way: and the re-opening of its place of worship, after
considerable alteration, appeared a suitable time for offering
these records to notice, in a permanent and connected form.</p>
<p>Publications of dissenting church history have not usually
received extensive encouragement.&nbsp; That circumstance is, I
believe, chiefly attributable to the anxiety of dissenting
ministers and parents, in general, to inculcate and maintain the
principles of personal religion, rather than the peculiarities of
nonconformity.&nbsp; A just preference, unquestionably,&mdash;but
which has betrayed many into a neglect of topics immensely,
though not supremely, important.&nbsp; The youth of dissenting
families too frequently <a name="pagevi"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. vi</span>grow up in ignorance of any other
reason for their nonconformity than parental example.&nbsp; The
natural result is, that &ldquo;by and by, when persecution
ariseth,&rdquo; or when fashion, or emolument, or the attractive
pomp of the national worship, allures, they forsake the ground
which their ancestors maintained at the peril of liberty, and of
life itself.</p>
<p>Viewed in this light, the prevalent disregard of such subjects
becomes a powerful inducement to invite attention to them.&nbsp;
Nor am I altogether without hope that local associations and
attachments, may, in the present instance, be subservient to such
a purpose.&nbsp; At all events, I am desirous that my humble
compilation should not be regarded as a <i>mere</i> depository of
what is curious; but should tend to encourage a thoughtful and
candid investigation of the history and principles of
nonconformity, as they are developed in works of wider interest
and higher literary pretensions. <a name="citationvi"></a><a
href="#footnotevi" class="citation">[vi]</a></p>
<p><a name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vii</span>Hence
I have been induced to sketch at some length, though, I am aware,
very imperfectly, the rise of nonconformity in the East Anglian
counties,&mdash;a topic which deserves to be separately
discussed, with the aids of extensive knowledge and ample
leisure.</p>
<p>The value of such a book as this greatly depends upon its
accuracy and fidelity.&nbsp; At the same time it must be
recollected, that general inferences cannot be deduced from
isolated facts.&nbsp; The cause of nonconformity, if it be the
cause of truth, will not ultimately suffer from the most candid
development of its local history.</p>
<p>I do not know that what I have written can justly give offence
to an individual of any communion.&nbsp; There is high
ecclesiastical authority <a name="citationvii"></a><a
href="#footnotevii" class="citation">[vii]</a> for the sentiment,
that &ldquo;whatever moderation or charity we may owe to
men&rsquo;s <a name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
viii</span>persons, we owe none at all to their errors, or to
that frame which is built on and supported by them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I must not omit to acknowledge the assistance I have received
from several ministers and other friends; especially the Rev.
Edward Hickman, of Denton, to whom I am indebted for material aid
in compiling the account of his intimate and lamented friend, Mr.
Sloper.</p>
<p>My express thanks are also due to the Rev. Dr. Owen, Rector of
Beccles, for the readiness and courtesy with which he allowed me
to inspect the early parochial registers in his possession.</p>

<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>CHAPTER
I.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm">Antiquity of dissent from state
religions&mdash;Leading principles of modern nonconformity:
authority of Christ; sufficiency of the Scriptures; duty of
examining and privilege of interpreting their
contents&mdash;Right of private judgment claimed by its
enemies&mdash;Position and duty of those by whom it is
conceded&mdash;Illustrations from English ecclesiastical
history&mdash;This right asserted by the first converts to
Christianity; by the reformers&mdash;Henry VIII.&mdash;Edward
VI.&mdash;Mary; seeks support from Suffolk protestants; promises
toleration; practices persecution&mdash;East Anglian counties
abound with protestants; they petition the queen; are rebuked;
and remonstrate with her commissioners in vain.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> has been remarked by Lord Bacon,
that &ldquo;those times are ancient when the world is ancient,
and not those we vulgarly account so, by counting backwards: so
that the present time is the real antiquity.&rdquo;&nbsp; Modern
institutions are not hastily to be rejected as impertinent or
crude; <a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>for
they are frequently found to exhibit the successful result of a
protracted struggle between truth and error, or to imbody the
accumulated wisdom of many generations.&nbsp; But if it be
contended that, in speculations relating to religion,
&ldquo;<i>quod verum</i>, <i>id antiquissimum</i>,&rdquo; that
antiquity is the test of truth; they who claim to be free from
all human authority in religious affairs, need not shrink from
the application of such a principle.&nbsp; The origin of dissent
from &ldquo;the commandments of men,&rdquo; on such subjects,
must be sought at a period far more remote than the rise of
Independent Churches in England.&nbsp; Under the Old Testament
dispensation, nonconformity, thus understood, was nobly
exemplified and divinely sanctioned in the instances of Daniel,
and the three Hebrew youths.&nbsp; During the apostolic times its
course was distinctly marked.&nbsp; It has since mingled with the
impurities, and has sometimes been almost lost amid the
intellectual and moral stagnation, of passing ages.&nbsp; At
length opposing elements again brought it more conspicuously into
notice: obstruction augmented the rapidity of its current; and it
will flow on <a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>until it shall be lost in the ocean of piety and freedom,
which is destined to cover the whole earth.</p>
<p>The leading principle of nonconformity, as the term is now
generally employed, to signify a continued separation from the
national church of England, is, the <i>sole</i> authority of
Jesus Christ as the head and lawgiver of his people.&nbsp; This
exclusive right he is alleged to have claimed, when he cautioned
his disciples against the assumption of ecclesiastical power,
emphatically reminding them that <i>One</i> was their master,
&ldquo;even Christ.&rdquo; <a name="citation3"></a><a
href="#footnote3" class="citation">[3]</a>&nbsp; A sentiment,
which, from the peculiar form of its announcement, he appears to
have intended that they should adopt as a principle and quote as
an axiom of his government.&nbsp; All that <i>he</i> taught them,
they were bound to obey; all that <i>he</i> enjoined, they were
to practise; and he discharged them, by that brief and memorable
sentence, from all spiritual allegiance to each other, and to
their fellow-men, however exalted or wise.&nbsp; Reason,
persuasion, the evidence of the <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>sacred writings, &ldquo;the effectual
fervent prayer,&rdquo; and the eloquence of a holy life, these
were the weapons he put into their hands, the only weapons
adapted to the genius of his religion and to the nature of man.
<a name="citation4"></a><a href="#footnote4"
class="citation">[4]</a></p>
<p><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>From this
view of Christ&rsquo;s authority is derived another principle
scarcely less momentous,&mdash;the absolute sufficiency of the
sacred Scriptures, &ldquo;the word of Christ,&rdquo; to prescribe
the faith and regulate the practice of his followers.&nbsp; A
revelation inadequate to these purposes, it is generally
admitted, would be at once derogatory to God, and a cruel mockery
of erring man.&nbsp; Nor can the perplexity arising out of
contending human powers, and conflicting articles of faith and
rules of practice, be avoided, but by submitting all to one
criterion,&mdash;&ldquo;to the law and to the
testimony,&rdquo;&mdash;and by the consideration that &ldquo;if
they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no
light in them.&rdquo; <a name="citation5"></a><a
href="#footnote5" class="citation">[5]</a></p>
<p><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>The
Bible, possessing such claims, addresses itself to every rational
creature with an individuality which none can evade, and fixes
upon each a responsibility which cannot be delegated.&nbsp; Hence
there appears (at least in the apprehension of a nonconformist)
to devolve upon every one to whom the page of revelation is
accessible, the sacred and inalienable right, or rather the
imperious and solemn duty, of personally examining its contents
and submitting to its precepts.&nbsp; Since its Author has
commissioned none to dictate its interpretation, he has, in
effect, granted to all a perfect freedom of inquiry and
discussion.&nbsp; Nor is it less a duty than a privilege, to aid,
as circumstances may allow, in elucidating its doctrines and
requirements, and in promoting the practice and the promulgation
of such views of religion and forms of worship as an enlightened
conscience may approve.&nbsp; This right alone, it is urged,
could <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>justify &ldquo;Peter and the other apostles&rdquo; when
they openly disobeyed the command of the high priest; and,
without claiming any special exemption in their own case, laid
down as the ground of their conduct, the general principle
&ldquo;we ought to obey God rather than men.&rdquo; <a
name="citation7a"></a><a href="#footnote7a"
class="citation">[7a]</a>&nbsp; They deduced their duty from
their convictions; and while their enemies &ldquo;took counsel to
slay them,&rdquo; they firmly resisted the interference of human
authority between their own consciences and that God who
&ldquo;seeketh such to worship Him&rdquo; as &ldquo;worship Him
in spirit and in truth.&rdquo; <a name="citation7b"></a><a
href="#footnote7b" class="citation">[7b]</a>&nbsp; Unhappily
there has not always been found, among persecutors, a Gamaliel to
point out the propriety and the result of allowing the free
publication of religious opinions.&nbsp; &ldquo;Refrain,&rdquo;
said he, in terms, a due regard to which would have saved mankind
from an inconceivable amount of suffering; &ldquo;refrain from
these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work
be of men, it will come to nought: but if it be of God, ye cannot
overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against
God.&rdquo; <a name="citation7c"></a><a href="#footnote7c"
class="citation">[7c]</a></p>
<p><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>Nonconformity, then, dates its existence from the time
when the secular power first infringed upon the liberty wherewith
Christ had made his disciples free.&nbsp; It professes to be
jealous of <i>his</i> authority, and to adhere to <i>his</i> laws
and institutions.&nbsp; Though ever so palatable or ever so
bitter a draught be presented from another source, it still dares
to draw from the well-spring of truth the waters of everlasting
life which he came to dispense.&nbsp; Whatever, in modes of faith
or forms of worship, may be enjoined by civil or ecclesiastical
powers, it prefers &ldquo;to keep close to the college of
fishermen, and to the doctrine of inspired apostles; to a
Scriptural creed and a spiritual worship.&rdquo; <a
name="citation8"></a><a href="#footnote8"
class="citation">[8]</a>&nbsp; It claims, in a word, to be the
only <i>true</i> conformity.</p>
<p>The right of private judgment in religious matters, which
follows immediately from the first principles of dissent, has
been too generally denied by the rulers of this world to their
subjects.&nbsp; <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>Nevertheless, its enemies have frequently been
constrained to bear a <i>practical</i> testimony in its
favour.&nbsp; Under varying circumstances in our own history, for
instance, this indestructible privilege has been assumed,
alternately, by the christian convert from paganism, by the
protestant, and the papist, again by the reformer, again by the
Roman catholic, and, still more recently, by the puritan, and the
dissenter from protestant establishments.&nbsp; This is the
moving power which has caused, and the unfailing clew which has
run through, all these changes, and will only find its
termination in the perfect concord and liberty of the universal
church.</p>
<p>To the truly liberal and candid, it must be a subject of
profound regret, that, for so many ages, no party duly
appreciated, or heartily countenanced, the liberty which each, in
turn, asserted.&nbsp; But in proportion to the sorrow which such
a view of ecclesiastical history occasions, will be the joy, if a
gradual though tardy approach to the full recognition of the
rights of conscience can be perceived; and especially if it be
discovered, that there has long existed a numerous and
intelligent <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>portion of the christian world, among whom those rights
have not only been claimed, but generally conceded; not merely
assumed to serve a purpose, but watched and advocated as the
invaluable and inalienable birthright of man.&nbsp; And although
it will be admitted as a sad evidence of human frailty, if
intolerance be found lurking even among the class of persons just
referred to, yet, as a body, they ought never, on that account,
to be ranked with those whose principles would lead them to
enthral the conscience within creeds and formularies of
man&rsquo;s devising.&nbsp; The characteristic views of
congregational dissenters, containing the very elements of
freedom, rise up to condemn, with double energy, the least
departure from its laws in <i>them</i>.&nbsp; They, assuredly,
should be the last to lord it over the consciences of their
fellow-men, who, themselves, acknowledge in religious affairs, no
lawgiver but Christ, and no directory but the Bible. <a
name="citation10"></a><a href="#footnote10"
class="citation">[10]</a></p>
<p><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>A
glance at some of the great religious alternations which have
occurred in England, will serve to illustrate the preceding
remarks, and, at the same time, furnish occasion to trace,
imperfectly, the origin and operation of dissenting principles in
the locality to which the following pages are especially
devoted.&nbsp; Perhaps it may be found that institutions which,
even by the candid and charitable, are sometimes supposed to have
their foundation in a morbid disaffection towards secular <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>rulers, or at
best, in a too prurient scrupulousness, and to lead to anarchy
and infidelity, are based on nobler principles and tend to
happier results.</p>
<p>In various parts of the Roman empire, multitudes were
converted by the instrumentality of the apostles and their
successors, and many died in testimony of their sincerity, and in
defence of the right to deviate from human authorities in <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>their
religious creed.&nbsp; All the sanctions of Christianity were
addressed to the reason, the affections, the hopes, and the
fears, of the individual.&nbsp; Appealing from human tribunals to
the commission she had received from the King of kings, she
challenged the soul as the province of her undisputed sway; and
the sincere convert to Jesus Christ felt that he dared not, and
could not, had he dared, resign his faith at the bidding of any
mortal.</p>
<p>When Christianity was adopted as the religion of the empire,
and the clergy became wealthy and ambitious, the bishops of Rome
assumed a superiority over their brethren, and announced
themselves as possessing infallible authority in matters of
faith.&nbsp; A claim, which, in the darkness of the middle ages,
met with too ready a compliance, and has strikingly exemplified
the fearful consequences of departing from the plain rules of the
New Testament.</p>
<p>During the long reign of popery in England the general perusal
of the Scriptures was prohibited; the services of the sanctuary
were enveloped in a foreign language; a contribution <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>towards the
aggrandizement of the papal see furnished the customary atonement
for the worst crimes; and the extermination of heretics was
esteemed the brightest of virtues.</p>
<p>At length Wycliffe appeared;&mdash;he urged upon all the study
of the Scriptures as a book &ldquo;full of authority.&rdquo; <a
name="citation14"></a><a href="#footnote14"
class="citation">[14]</a>&mdash;Luther afterwards announced
himself a dissenter from the established faith.&nbsp; The
reformation was begun in Germany; and the writings of the
reformer were disseminated at home.</p>
<p>Henry the Eighth, on his accession, vainly thought to arrest
the growth of &ldquo;heresy&rdquo; by a rigorous execution of
penal statutes against the Lollards or Wycliffites, while he
unconsciously surrendered the principle of infallibility, on
which alone the attempt could be justified, by entering the arena
of controversy with Luther.&nbsp; The pope declared that the
royal pen had been guided by <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>inspiration, and rewarded
Henry&rsquo;s zeal with the title &ldquo;Defender of the
Faith.&rdquo;&nbsp; So illustrious a controversy naturally
attracted notice; and some were even presuming to compare the
merits of the combatants, when the prince himself shook off the
dominion of the Roman pontiff.&nbsp; But the privilege which, in
so doing, he claimed for himself, he was not prepared to grant to
others, though demanded by them on far worthier grounds.&nbsp; He
declared himself &ldquo;head of the church of England,&rdquo; <a
name="citation15a"></a><a href="#footnote15a"
class="citation">[15a]</a> taking care to explain that office as
including &ldquo;full power to visit and correct all heresies and
other abuses.&rdquo;&nbsp; Seizing, with a tyrant&rsquo;s grasp,
the torch which was destined to enlighten the moral world, he
employed it to guard his despotic sway and to kindle the fires of
persecution. <a name="citation15b"></a><a href="#footnote15b"
class="citation">[15b]</a>&nbsp; He dissolved the monasteries,
whose existence was inconsistent with the line of policy he had
adopted, and whose wealth furnished a powerful temptation.&nbsp;
The reading of the English Bible in churches was prohibited, as
well as its perusal by women, artificers, &amp;c.&nbsp; Spiritual
<a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>persons
maintaining any thing contrary to the king&rsquo;s instructions,
were to recant or be burned.&nbsp; Nearly all the leading
doctrines of the Romish faith were retained; and papists and
protestants went together to the stake, the former for denying
the supremacy, the latter for questioning the creed, of an
arbitrary and vicious monarch. <a name="citation16"></a><a
href="#footnote16" class="citation">[16]</a></p>
<p>On the death of Henry, a brighter era seemed to be
dawning.&nbsp; The Bible had already been published in English,
and had become the intelligent study of many.&nbsp; Edward the
Sixth, who succeeded to the throne, and those by whom his mind
was chiefly influenced, were favourable to the Reformation.&nbsp;
The right of private judgment, sanctioned alike by the example of
the prince and the subject, might reasonably have been expected
to receive encouragement, or at least protection.&nbsp; Hence
numerous confessors who had fled to the continent, returned
joyfully to their native land, <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>looking for ameliorated institutions,
and perhaps dreaming of entire liberty.</p>
<p>He who contemplates for the first time, this crisis of
religious history, imagines, like some of the early maritime
adventurers, that he is about to plant his foot upon the soil of
truth and freedom; but he speedily discovers that he is chasing a
beautiful illusion, and that many days of suffering and nights of
darkness must intervene before the vision can be realized.</p>
<p>Edward&rsquo;s advisers loosened the reins of ecclesiastical
authority: they were unconscious that no mortal should have ever
held them.&nbsp; Some statutes against the Lollards were
repealed.&nbsp; An act of parliament was passed allowing the
sacrament to be received by the laity in both kinds, of bread and
wine, whereas the cup had previously been confined to the
priests.&nbsp; Prescribing an improved form of worship, though
retaining much of superstition in deference to the popish party,
the legislature enjoined uniformity in the services and
sacraments of religion. <a name="citation17"></a><a
href="#footnote17" class="citation">[17]</a>&nbsp; Cranmer was
directed to draw up articles, with the delusive expectation <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>of
&ldquo;rooting out the discord of opinions.&rdquo;&nbsp; This led
to the imprisonment of many, and even to the burning of
some.&nbsp; But Edward&rsquo;s better judgment and his tender
heart revolted from the infliction of such a punishment.&nbsp; He
is said on one occasion, to have bedewed with tears the warrant
which he reluctantly signed for the execution of the law, and to
have told the archbishop &ldquo;that if he did wrong, since it
was in submission to his authority, he should answer for it to
God.&rdquo; <a name="citation18"></a><a href="#footnote18"
class="citation">[18]</a>&nbsp; Among those who dared to differ
from the established faith, were Bonner and Gardiner; and Mary,
the king&rsquo;s sister.&nbsp; They were incited by protestant
persecution, as well as by their own intolerant principles, to
the cruel course by which the succeeding reign is proverbially
distinguished.&nbsp; The princess pronounced in reply to
Edward&rsquo;s injunctions, at once her own apology and that of
her victims: &ldquo;Her soul,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;was
God&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary was at her manor of Keninghall in Norfolk, when
consumption carried off the young and promising king.&nbsp; His
regard for the cause of the reformation had induced him to
nominate as <a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>his successor the Lady Jane Grey in preference to Mary,
in whose mind the claims of the papacy had been long identified
with the rights of her mother Catharine of Arragon.&nbsp; Finding
her claim to the crown disputed by some of the leading nobles,
Mary sought to engage the commons in her cause.&nbsp; With this
view she &ldquo;speedeth herself secretly away&rdquo; (to use the
quaint but expressive language of Fox) &ldquo;into the
North.&rdquo;&nbsp; She soon learned that the council had sent
out the Duke of Northumberland with an army in support of her
rival, and &ldquo;tossed with much travel up and down, to work
the surest way for her best advantage, withdrew herself into the
quarters of Northfolk and Suffolk, where she understood the
Duke&rsquo;s name to be had in much hatred for the service that
had been done there of late, under King Edward, in subduing the
rebels; and there gathering to her such aid of the commons on
every side as she might, keeping [kept] herself close for a space
within <i>Fremingham Castle</i>. <a name="citation19"></a><a
href="#footnote19" class="citation">[19]</a>&nbsp; To whom, first
of all, resorted <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>the Suffolk men; who being always forward in promoting
the proceedings of the gospel, promised her their aid and help,
so that she would not attempt the alteration of the religion
which her brother King Edward had before established, by laws and
orders publicly enacted and received by the consent of the whole
realm in that behalf.&nbsp; To make the matter short,&rdquo; adds
the historian, &ldquo;unto this condition she eftsoons <a
name="citation20a"></a><a href="#footnote20a"
class="citation">[20a]</a> agreed, with such promise made unto
them that no innovation should be made of religion, as that no
man would or could have misdoubted her. <a
name="citation20b"></a><a href="#footnote20b"
class="citation">[20b]</a>&nbsp; Which promise <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>if she had as
constantly kept as they did willingly preserve her with their
bodies and weapons, she had done a deed both worthy her blood,
and had also made her reign more stable to herself through future
tranquillity.&nbsp; For though a man be never so puissant of
power, yet breach of promise is an evil upholder of quietness;
fear is worse; but cruelty is the worst of all.&rdquo; <a
name="citation21a"></a><a href="#footnote21a"
class="citation">[21a]</a></p>
<p>Mary no sooner found herself, by &ldquo;the power of the
gospellers,&rdquo; firmly seated on the throne, than she
qualified the promises she had made them in the hour of need,
declaring, that she would not compel her subjects to be of her
religion, <i>till public order should be taken in it by common
consent</i>. <a name="citation21b"></a><a href="#footnote21b"
class="citation">[21b]</a>&nbsp; A parliament sufficiently
obsequious was assembled; the laws passed in the preceding reign,
in favour of the reformation, were repealed, the service and
sacraments used at the <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>close of the reign of Henry the
Eighth, restored, <a name="citation22a"></a><a
href="#footnote22a" class="citation">[22a]</a> and the crown and
realm of England formally reconciled to the papal see.&nbsp; A
series of barbarities ensued, under the alleged sanction of
religion, at the recital of which humanity shudders.&nbsp; The
persecutors had been taught in the school of their victims, and
neither party understood the principles of religious
liberty.&nbsp; All the people were required to come to church,
where the mass was revived. <a name="citation22b"></a><a
href="#footnote22b" class="citation">[22b]</a>&nbsp; To deny the
supremacy of the pope, was once more become as heinous an offence
as it had been to question that of Henry the Eighth during the
latter years of his reign.&nbsp; The dungeon and the faggot <a
name="citation22c"></a><a href="#footnote22c"
class="citation">[22c]</a> were the arguments by which erring
judgments and tender consciences were to be restored and
comforted.&nbsp; When some members of the convocation declined
subscribing to the doctrine of transubstantiation, the discussion
was terminated with the following conclusive reasoning:
&ldquo;<i>You</i>,&rdquo; said the prolocutor, &ldquo;have the
<i>word</i>, <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>but <i>we</i> have the <i>sword</i>.&rdquo; <a
name="citation23a"></a><a href="#footnote23a"
class="citation">[23a]</a>&nbsp; An argument which has not
unfrequently been employed in behalf of a state religion in more
enlightened times.</p>
<p>Rogers, the protomartyr of Mary&rsquo;s short but frightfully
sanguinary career, died because he would acknowledge no head but
Christ, of his catholic church, and no authority above the word
of God. <a name="citation23b"></a><a href="#footnote23b"
class="citation">[23b]</a>&nbsp; Saunders, Hooper, Bradford,
Latimer, Ridley, and the frail but afterwards repentant and
magnanimous Cranmer, with a multitude of less eminent but equally
honourable and worthy men, expired in the flames, to testify
their attachment to a faith which, three years earlier, their
rulers had taught them to admire and maintain.</p>
<p>Suffolk, and the adjacent maritime counties, had always been
the stronghold of protestantism.&nbsp; Their geographical
situation occasioned considerable intercourse with the continent,
where the reformation still flourished, and whither many were
self-exiled for conscience&rsquo; sake.&nbsp; At a much earlier
period the Lollards appear to have been numerous in Norfolk; they
had been multiplied <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>by persecution, and by a comparatively extensive
circulation of the writings of the reformers. <a
name="citation24a"></a><a href="#footnote24a"
class="citation">[24a]</a>&nbsp; Undeterred by the terrible
examples of the queen&rsquo;s severity, the protestants of
Suffolk and Essex met privately for religious worship. <a
name="citation24b"></a><a href="#footnote24b"
class="citation">[24b]</a>&nbsp; Great numbers entirely forsook
the public authorized service.&nbsp; At Stoke in Suffolk, there
was a congregation of protestants, so considerable in number and
so united in their views, that the bishops for some time
hesitated to interfere.&nbsp; And at last, when the whole society
was required to come to church, they contrived to escape, leaving
their angry diocesan first to suspend, and then to excommunicate
them. <a name="citation24c"></a><a href="#footnote24c"
class="citation">[24c]</a></p>
<p>Every where the protestants had to endure the anxiety
attending an exposure to the vengeance of their enemies, or the
privations and inconveniences of concealment.&nbsp; Indescribably
dreadful as the pains of martyrdom must have been, they were
brief in their duration, and their very <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>bitterness
kindled the pity of the spectator and the fortitude of the
victim.&nbsp; Perhaps the total amount of misery which they
occasioned, was overbalanced by the less agonizing, but more
protracted and retired, sufferings of the multitudes who
&ldquo;wandered in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens, and in
caves of the earth,&rdquo; and &ldquo;of whom&rdquo; (with equal
truth it might be affirmed) &ldquo;the world was not
worthy.&rdquo;&nbsp; The following are, probably, neither rare
nor extreme instances.&nbsp; In the parish of St. James, near
Bungay, there resided a family named Fisk.&nbsp; Of six brothers,
three were protestants.&nbsp; A pursuivant employed to apprehend
one of them, gave him, from motives of personal friendship, a
private notice of the intention to seize him.&nbsp; Whereupon,
the good man first called his family to prayer, and then hastened
away to hide himself in a ditch, with his godly wife and her
helpless babe.&nbsp; Another of these brothers was, to avoid
burning, hid many months in a pile of wood; and afterwards, for
half a year, in a cellar, where he diligently employed himself in
profitable manufactures by candlelight; but his many hardships
brought on an excessive <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>bleeding, which shortened his days,
and added unto the cry of the &ldquo;souls under the
altar.&rdquo; <a name="citation26a"></a><a href="#footnote26a"
class="citation">[26a]</a></p>
<p>Calling to mind their own efforts and the queen&rsquo;s
promise, the Suffolk protestants ventured to send a deputation to
her to represent their grievances.&nbsp; But, &ldquo;it
was,&rdquo; as Fox very justly remarks, &ldquo;an heavy word that
she answered them: &lsquo;Forasmuch,&rsquo; saith she, &lsquo;as
you, being but members, desire to rule your head, you shall one
day well perceive that members must obey their head, and not look
to bear rule over the same.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a
name="citation26b"></a><a href="#footnote26b"
class="citation">[26b]</a>&nbsp; One of the deputation having
referred to the particular ground on which they rested their
claims, was put in the pillory three days, and had his ears cut
off.</p>
<p>When the queen and council sent commissioners to Norfolk and
Suffolk &ldquo;to enquire into matters of religion,&rdquo; a
supplication was presented <a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>&ldquo;by some good and well disposed
men dwelling about those parts,&rdquo; <a
name="citation27"></a><a href="#footnote27"
class="citation">[27]</a> in which they contended earnestly for
the superiority of King Edward&rsquo;s ritual.&nbsp; &ldquo;All
our bodies, goods, lands, and lives,&rdquo; say they, &ldquo;are
ready to do her Grace faithful obedience and true service of all
commandments that are not against God and his word: but in things
that import a denial of Christ, and refusal of his word and holy
communion, we cannot consent nor agree unto it . . . We think it
no true obedience unto the queen&rsquo;s highness or to any other
magistrate ordained of God under her, to obey in the things
contrary to God&rsquo;s word, although the same be never so
straitly charged in her Grace&rsquo;s name . . . We think not
good by any unlawful stir or commotion, to seek remedy . . . But
unto such ungodly bishoplike commandments, as are against God, we
answer with the apostles, <i>God must be obeyed rather than
man</i>.&nbsp; If persecution shall ensue, (which some threaten
us with,) we desire the heavenly Father, according to his
promise, to look from heaven, to hear <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>our cry, to judge between us and our
adversaries, and to give us faith, strength, and patience, to
continue faithful unto the end, and to shorten these evil days
for his chosen&rsquo;s sake; and so we faithfully believe he
will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The queen was alike deaf to reason and regardless of her
promise.&nbsp; She answered the remonstrances of those who
reverenced the Scriptures more than her command, and valued
conscience more than life, with the most fearful torments bigotry
and tyranny could inflict.&nbsp; Suffolk furnished its share of
victims.&nbsp; Amongst them were, Dr. Rowland Taylor of Hadleigh,
and three men who suffered in the town, to which the subsequent
records more immediately relate.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Description of Beccles&mdash;modern
improvements&mdash;probable state in the reign of Mary; the scene
of persecution&mdash;Fox&rsquo;s account of the burning of three
men; their examination; sentence; articles against them; their
conduct and treatment at the stake&mdash;Remarks.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> point of situation and general
appearance, Beccles has been accounted by some worthy to rank as
the third town in Suffolk.&nbsp; Towards the west it is skirted
by a cliff, once washed by the estuary which separated the
eastern parts of Norfolk and Suffolk. <a name="citation29"></a><a
href="#footnote29" class="citation">[29]</a>&nbsp; A portion of
the most elevated ground is occupied by the parish church and
church-yard, commanding a view somewhat more <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>expanded and
interesting than is common in this part of the county.&nbsp; It
overlooks the valley of the appropriately designated river
Waveney.&nbsp; The church is a handsome building, said to have
been erected about A.D. 1369.&nbsp; Its south porch, of rather
more recent date, affords a fine specimen of highly ornamented
Gothic architecture. <a name="citation30a"></a><a
href="#footnote30a" class="citation">[30a]</a>&nbsp; A massive
tower of freestone, erected early in the sixteenth century,
stands apart from the church.&nbsp; The other principal
buildings, for public purposes, are, a town-hall; a spacious
modern gaol; a theatre; an assembly room, to which is attached an
apartment used as a public library; a free school for instruction
in &ldquo;writing, cyphering, and learning,&rdquo; and in the
established religion; a meeting-house belonging to the Society of
Friends, appropriated to the purpose of an infant school room; <a
name="citation30b"></a><a href="#footnote30b"
class="citation">[30b]</a> and the meeting-houses or chapels of
<a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>the
Independent, Baptist, and Wesleyan denominations of
christians.</p>
<p>The population of Beccles, as stated in the census of 1831,
was 3862, and is considered to be gradually increasing.&nbsp; The
town possesses the commercial advantage of a communication by
water with the sea at Yarmouth and Lowestoft.&nbsp; An extensive
tract of marshes, formerly held by the abbot of Bury St.
Edmund&rsquo;s, as part of the manor of Beccles, has long been
vested in incorporated trustees for the benefit of the
inhabitants.&nbsp; There are also other lands held for charitable
uses.</p>
<p>It is probable, that long before the arm of the sea had
retired within the humble banks of the Waveney&mdash;while
Yarmouth was yet a sand-bank, swept by the ocean&mdash;the spot
in question had become the settled abode of some who found in the
adjacent waters a ready means of subsistence. <a
name="citation31"></a><a href="#footnote31"
class="citation">[31]</a>&nbsp; <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>It is generally supposed that the
name, Beccles, was adopted with reference to a church which had
been built here at an early period. <a name="citation32"></a><a
href="#footnote32" class="citation">[32]</a>&nbsp; Possibly
Sigebert, king of the East Angles, and founder of a monastery at
Bury, might select this place, <a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>among others, for the establishment
and propagation of the Christian faith, which he had imbibed
during a voluntary exile in France. <a name="citation33"></a><a
href="#footnote33" class="citation">[33]</a>&nbsp; The manor and
advowson of Beccles were granted by King Edwy, about A.D. 956, to
the monks of Bury, and remained in their possession until the
dissolution of the religious houses under Henry the Eighth.</p>
<p>In most of its local features, as well as in its commercial,
civil, and moral interests, the town has, no doubt, greatly
improved since the period to which the close of the preceding
chapter refers.&nbsp; Navigation and intercourse with other
inland places have been facilitated; and trade, adapting itself
to existing circumstances, has been extended.&nbsp; More
efficient municipal regulations, and advancing civilization, have
contributed to the preservation of order, and led to an extension
of privileges to the inhabitants.&nbsp; Considerable progress has
been made towards an improved system of prison <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>discipline.
<a name="citation34"></a><a href="#footnote34"
class="citation">[34]</a>&nbsp; Schools, public and private,
have, in some degree, tended to raise the tone of society, to
soften the obdurate, and to tame the rude.&nbsp; The attachment
to cruel, sensual, and frivolous amusements has abated, and a
regard to the pursuits of literature and science has become
perceptible.&nbsp; Nor can it be reasonably doubted that the
exercise of an evangelical ministry in the separate congregation
of the Independents, for nearly two centuries, and the labours of
Christian ministers of other denominations, have been productive
of incalculable moral, intellectual, and religious advantages to
the town and neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The aspect of the place must have been very different when
Mary succeeded to the crown of <a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>England.&nbsp; The parish church and
its &ldquo;beautiful gate,&rdquo; were then <i>more</i> beautiful
than at present.&nbsp; The tower, still the characteristic local
feature of the town, was fresh and fair from the hands of the
architect.&nbsp; Besides the wealthy abbey, there had been many
contributors to the erection of these buildings, who had evinced
a zeal in the completion of them worthy the imitation of
protestants.&nbsp; But there is reason to believe that to those
features a strong contrast was presented in the generally mean
appearance, the gross ignorance, and moral deformity of the
town.&nbsp; Coarse rushes, produced by the common lands with an
abundance sufficiently indicative of an almost worthless soil,
furnished the carpet and the covering of most of the
dwelling-houses. <a name="citation35a"></a><a href="#footnote35a"
class="citation">[35a]</a>&nbsp; Superstition prevailed in the
public services of the sanctuary.&nbsp; The &ldquo;men of
wyrship&rdquo; appear to have been greatly deficient in
forbearance and liberality, while a large portion of the
inhabitants were boisterously tenacious of civil rights, which
they were scarcely competent to manage. <a
name="citation35b"></a><a href="#footnote35b"
class="citation">[35b]</a>&nbsp; The seal <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>of the late
corporation of Beccles Fen bears such a representation of the
gaol, existing in 1584, as leaves no room to question the account
of &ldquo;one having <i>hewed</i> himself out of it.&rdquo; <a
name="citation36"></a><a href="#footnote36"
class="citation">[36]</a></p>
<p>Prodigal of human suffering as Mary was, it was nevertheless a
part of her usual policy to make each instance of capital
punishment for heresy <i>tell</i> as extensively as
possible.&nbsp; Beccles, the centre of a rural district in which
the principles of protestantism had taken root, never to be
eradicated, was chosen to be the scene of the first martyrdom by
which her agents in the diocese of Norwich sought to terrify her
subjects into conformity.&nbsp; The account given by Fox of the
occurrence, must occupy a place in these pages.&nbsp; It is
intimately connected with the history of nonconformity in
Beccles.</p>
<p>Such punishments for such offences, wherever they were
inflicted, could not fail to rouse a spirit of inquiry.&nbsp; Men
would naturally turn from a spectacle so horrifying to
investigate the basis of the institution it was intended to
support, and <a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>to search into the expediency of intrusting the rule of
faith with human beings, whose fallibility did not abate a
particle of their bigotry.&nbsp; The more conspicuous the
sufferings of the martyrs were made, the more certainly and
extensively did they tend to the dissemination of truth and
freedom.</p>
<p>The faithful historian, having recorded and done honour to the
Christian heroism of several &ldquo;constant professors of
Christ&rdquo; who were burned at Colchester, Stratford le Bow,
Smithfield, and Gloucester, thus proceeds:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<i>Three burnt
at Beckles</i>. <a name="citation37"></a><a href="#footnote37"
class="citation">[37]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;After the death of these aboue rehearsed, were three
menne burnt at Beckles in Suffolk, in one fire, about the 21 day
of May, An. 1556, whose names are hereunder specified&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thomas Spicer, of Winston, laborer,</p>
<p>&ldquo;John Deny, and Edmund Poole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This Thomas Spicer was a single man, of the age of
nineteene yeares, and by vocation a labourer, <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>dwelling in
Winston, the countie of Suffolke, and there taken in his
maister&rsquo;s house in summer, about or anone after the rising
of the sunne, (being in his bed,) by James Ling and John Keretch
of the same towne, and Wil. Dauies of Debnam, in the saide
Countie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The occasion of his taking was, for that he would not
go to their popish church to heare masse, and receive their idoll
at the commandement of Sir John Tirrell, Knight, of Gipping hall
in Suffolke, and certaine other Justices there, whoe sent both
him and them to Eye dungeon, in Suffolke, till at length they
were all three togither brought before Dunning, then chancellor
of Norwich, and M. Mings the Register, sitting at the town of
Beckles, to be examined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there the said Chancellor perswading what he coulde
to turn them from the truth, could by no meanes preuaile of his
purpose.&nbsp; Whereby minding in the ende to giue sentence on
them, hee burst out in teares, intreating them to remember
themselues, and to turne againe to the holie mother church, for
that they were deceiued and out of the truth, and that they shold
not wilfully <a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>cast awaie themselues, with such like words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now as he was thus labouring them and seemed very loth
to read the sentence, (for they were the first that he condemned
in that dioces,) the Register there sitting by, being weary,
belike, of tarying, or else perceiuing the constant martyrs to
bee at a point, called upon the chancellor in haste, to rid them
out of the waie, and to make an ende.&nbsp; At the which words
the chancellor read the condemnation ouer them with teares, and
deliuered them to the secular power.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<i>Their Articles</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The articles obiected to these, and commonlie to all
other condemned in that diocesse by Doctor Hopton, Bishoppe of
Norwich, and by Dunning his chancellor, were these:</p>
<p>&ldquo;1.&nbsp; First, was articulate against them that they
beleeued not the Pope of Rome to bee supreame head immediatelie
under Christ in earth of the uniuersall catholike church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;2.&nbsp; Item, that they beleeued not holie bread and
holie water, ashes, palmes, and all other like <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>ceremonies
used in the church to bee good and laudable for stirring up the
people to deuotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;3.&nbsp; Item, that they beleeued not, after the words
of consecration spoken by the priest, the very naturall body of
Christ, and no other substance of bread and wine to be in the
sacrament of the altar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;4.&nbsp; Item, that they beleeued it to be idolatry to
worship Christ in the sacrament of the altar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;5.&nbsp; Item, that they tooke bread and Wine in
remembrance of Christ&rsquo;s passion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;6.&nbsp; Item, that they would not followe the crosse
in procession, nor be confessed to a priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;7.&nbsp; Item, that they affirmed no mortall man to
haue in himselfe free will to do good or euill. <a
name="citation40"></a><a href="#footnote40"
class="citation">[40]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;For this doctrine and articles aboue prefixed these
three (as is aforesaid) were condemned by doctor Dunning, and
committed to the secular power, Sir John Sylliard beinge the same
time high sheriffe of Northfolke and Suffolke.</p>
<p><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>&ldquo;And the next day following uppon the same they
were all burnt togither in the said towne of Beckles. <a
name="citation41a"></a><a href="#footnote41a"
class="citation">[41a]</a>&nbsp; Whereupon it is to be thought
that the writte <i>de comburendo</i> was not yet come downe nor
could not be, the Lord Chancellor, Bishoppe Heath, being the same
time at London. <a name="citation41b"></a><a href="#footnote41b"
class="citation">[41b]</a>&nbsp; Which, if it bee true, then it
is plaine, that both they went beyond their commission that were
the executioners, and also the clergie, which were the
instigatours thereof, cannot make good that they now pretend,
saying that they did nothing but by a lawe.&nbsp; But this let
the Lord finde out when he seeth his time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the meane time, while these good men were at the
stake, and had praied, they saide their beleefe; <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>and when they
came to the reciting of &lsquo;the catholike church,&rsquo; Sir
John Silliard spake to them; &lsquo;That is well said, sirs,
quoth he, I am glad to heare you saie you do beleeue the
catholike church; that is the best word I heard of you
yet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To which his sayings, Edmund Poole answered, thogh they
beleeue the catholike church, yet doe they not beleeue in their
popish church, which is no part of Christ&rsquo;s catholike
church, and therefore no part of their beliefe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When they rose from praier, they all went ioyfullie to
the stake, and being bound therto, and the fire burning about
them, they praised God in such an audible voice, that it was
wonderful to all those that stood by and heard them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then one Robert Bacon, dwelling in the saide Beckles, a
very enemie to God&rsquo;s truth, and a persecutor of his people,
being there present within hearing thereof, willed the tormentors
to throwe on faggots to stop the knaues&rsquo; breathes, as he
tearmed them; so hot was his burning charitie.&nbsp; But these
good men, not regarding their malice, confessed the truth, and
yeelded their lives to the <a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>death, for the testimonie of the
same, very gloriouslie and ioyfullie.&nbsp; The which their
constancie, in the like cause, the Lord grant wee may imitate and
followe unto the ende: whether it bee death or life, to glorifie
the name of Christ.&nbsp; Amen.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These were the nonconformists of their day.&nbsp; Ignominy and
torture were, in their estimation, preferable to the reproaches
of an enslaved and guilty soul.&nbsp; But it is not for the
purpose of indulging an acrimonious feeling towards the immediate
or remote perpetrators of a legalized murder that this account
has been introduced.&nbsp; The severity of the punishment is of
minor importance, except as it places in a strong light the
fallacious and mischievous principle from which it
originated.&nbsp; The question is not, whether these men ought in
justice to have suffered less than they did; whether, instead of
being roasted amidst the scoffs of a depraved and deluded rabble,
they should have been burnt in the hand, or branded on the
forehead, or scourged and suffered to depart; or whether there
should have been substituted for the pangs of martyrdom, only the
deprivation of <a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>some civil rights, or the exaction of &ldquo;a
peppercorn rent&rdquo; in testimony that they had &ldquo;an
interest in the services&rdquo; <a name="citation44"></a><a
href="#footnote44" class="citation">[44]</a> of the national
church, and in acknowledgment of their spiritual allegiance to a
blood thirsty and despotic woman.&nbsp; It is not whether on
their submission to such terms they should have been pitied on
account of their errors, and tolerated on the score of their
sincerity and their peaceableness.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; The inquiry
which presents itself is, whether the exaction of the very
smallest possible penalty, with whatsoever name it might have
been gilded over, would not have involved the violation of a
principle of incalculable moment to the interests of religion, of
justice, and of freedom.&nbsp; The queen would still, if the
grounds of modern nonconformity be tenable, have outstepped her
province, and have interfered with rights derived from a source
paramount to her own.</p>
<p>The charge brought against the Beccles martyrs was, in
substance, that their religious creed and observances differed
from those of the Roman Catholic church, which had been set
forth, <a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>by
public authority, for the adoption of all.&nbsp; It is deserving
of notice, that of the seven articles which constitute their
accusation, four relate exclusively to an erroneous
<i>belief</i>.&nbsp; Thus the very recesses of the heart were
invaded.&nbsp; The faith of the unfortunate man, who could not
find the doctrines of popery in his Bible, was extracted from him
by interrogatories, and he was compelled to expiate in the flames
the crime of preserving &ldquo;a conscience void of offence
towards God.&rdquo;&nbsp; The remaining allegations relate to
outward ceremonies which these individuals regarded as
unscriptural and even idolatrous; and the observance of which, by
them, must therefore have been an abomination to the Searcher of
hearts. <a name="citation45"></a><a href="#footnote45"
class="citation">[45]</a>&nbsp; Him they refused to mock with a
worse than formal service.&nbsp; And for these offences their
fellow-creatures proceeded to &ldquo;rid them out of the
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>Such is
bigotry in the most hideous aspect she assumes.&nbsp; But if the
principle be admitted, that faith or practice in religion is a
fit subject for magisterial interference, it surely savours of
harshness to censure Mary for affording her patronage to the
creed she had sincerely imbibed, and to the rites she had been
taught by maternal lips to hold sacred.&nbsp; Nor can there be
any security that the supreme power in a state, if invested with
authority in matters of faith, shall not prefer the licentious
speculations of deism, or the delusions of the false
prophet.&nbsp; It is in vain to contend that the establishment of
the true religion alone is justifiable, for who is to solve the
question, What is truth?&nbsp; If the ruler; shall Henry, or
Edward, or Mary, or Elizabeth decide?&nbsp; Or shall the prince
be guided in his selection by the majority?&nbsp; In England the
suffrages may be in favour of episcopacy; in Scotland of
presbyterianism; in Ireland and in Canada of Catholicism; in
India of polytheism.&nbsp; Accordingly, with the exception of the
last, these several forms of religion are at present established
under the authority of the crown of Great Britain.&nbsp; Why does
<a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>not the
majority prevail in Ireland or in India?&nbsp; Is the alleged
idolatry of the sister island less tolerable than that of the
transatlantic colony? or are numbers of less account on the banks
of the Ganges than of the St. Lawrence?</p>
<p>But how multifarious and inconsistent a thing would thus be
made of religion!&nbsp; How are its beauty tarnished, its name
degraded, and its influence neutralized, by this admixture of
earthly elements, this rude and needless effort to grasp and to
uphold its etherial principles!&nbsp; Is truth thus mutable, or
can it be thus bandied from hand to hand?</p>
<p>Whatever is established by the authority, should also be
supported by the sanctions of government.&nbsp; And if gentle
methods prove insufficient to check an offence <i>cognizable by
the magistrate</i>, it is his duty to augment severity in
proportion to the obstinacy of the offender.&nbsp; If even the
dread of death fail to accomplish the desired reformation; to
mitigate the punishment is to exchange the character of a judge
for that of a tormentor, to lay aside the semblance of a wise and
beneficent discipline, and to indulge the <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>gratification
of a wanton and useless cruelty. <a name="citation48a"></a><a
href="#footnote48a" class="citation">[48a]</a>&nbsp; It would be
easier, in such a case, to justify the infliction of superadded
torture, than of the lightest penalty.</p>
<p>It is difficult to conceive that principles leading to such
results will ever again be allowed to prevail against the
liberties and lives of Englishmen.&nbsp; But if, as some
strangely apprehend it may, the Roman Catholic faith should
regain the ascendancy in this country, it would be interesting
and profitable to observe the course which would be adopted by
those who are at once enamoured of establishments, and at deadly
feud with popery.&nbsp; Some would, no doubt, be prepared, with
Archdeacon Balguy, &ldquo;to defend, not popery only, but
paganism itself&mdash;every <i>established</i> religion under
heaven.&rdquo; <a name="citation48b"></a><a href="#footnote48b"
class="citation">[48b]</a>&nbsp; But it may <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>reasonably be
supposed that such a sentiment would, in the present day, be very
generally discarded as antiquated and untenable.&nbsp; The
following language of a contemporary clergyman may, probably, be
considered as indicating the views with which the supposed event
would be more generally met by protestant episcopalians.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If the presbyterians or papists were to-morrow the great
majority of the nation, and if the constituted authorities of the
land, king, lords, and commons, thinking either of these
persuasions the best religion, were to establish it by law, <i>I
should then become a dissenter</i>.&nbsp; With my belief in the
scriptural authority of episcopacy, I could not conscientiously
be a presbyterian; and with my knowledge of the antiscriptural
doctrines of the church of Rome, <i>I must separate</i> from her
communion.&rdquo; <a name="citation49"></a><a href="#footnote49"
class="citation">[49]</a>&nbsp; The intelligent, <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>conscientious, and consistent protestant would make his
appeal, as did the martyrs, to the only supreme authority.&nbsp;
Here, he would say, placing his hand upon the word of God, here
alone, is &ldquo;the religion of protestants:&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;<i>Here</i> is the judge that stints the
strife<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When men&rsquo;s devices fail;<br />
Here is the bread that feeds the life<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That <i>death cannot</i> assail.&rdquo; <a
name="citation50"></a><a href="#footnote50"
class="citation">[50]</a></p>
<p>By the light of reason and in the exercise of prayer for that
better illumination which cometh from above, he would commit
himself to this safe guide.&nbsp; While he would value the
protection, and conform to the regulations, and discharge the
imposts, of civil government, in reference to things pertaining
to its province; if for his religious profession he endured
suffering or privation, whatever its garb, its nature, or its
extent, he would resist with firmness; or succumb with
reluctance, and complain of persecution.&nbsp; The absence of the
faggot or the rack would not be admitted to purge away the stain
of <a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>injustice. <a name="citation51a"></a><a
href="#footnote51a" class="citation">[51a]</a>&nbsp; Whether
debarred of personal liberty, or of some minor privilege of
citizenship; subject to a legal slaughter, or to a legal tax; he
would regard the champions of established catholicism as
trampling upon the just liberties of a Christian man.&nbsp; He
could give them, at best, no more that the poor praise of having
learned to imitate the Italian assassins, who beat their victims
with satchels of sand: no blood is spilt and no bones are
broken&mdash;but the sufferer dies by the operation. <a
name="citation51b"></a><a href="#footnote51b"
class="citation">[51b]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Any sort</i> of punishment, disproportioned to the
offence, or where there is no fault at all, will always be
severity, unjustifiable severity, and will be thought so by the
sufferers and bystanders.&rdquo; <a name="citation52a"></a><a
href="#footnote52a" class="citation">[52a]</a>&nbsp; <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>However
disguised, or modified, or attenuated may be the persecution,
they will regard it as persecution still, and will justly apply
to its authors, with whatever communion they may be connected, or
whatever pretensions they may set up, the language Milton puts
into the lips of an archangel, to whom many of the episcopal
edifices are dedicated:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What

<p class="gutsumm">Queen Elizabeth, an intolerant protestant; her

&ldquo;prophesyings;&rdquo; suppressed by the

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> accession of Elizabeth, once
more, revived the hearts of the reformers.&nbsp; Her personal
character, indeed, afforded no hope of her being favourable to
freedom, though her parentage and education led to the reasonable
expectation that she would encourage protestantism.&nbsp; Of all
that was safe to be believed and fit to be practised, she deemed
herself the competent and supreme judge.&nbsp; Regarding the
privilege of dissenting <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>from the state religion as part of
her prerogative, she exercised that right herself, and then
sternly denied it, alike to the learned and the rude, the
conscientious and the careless, among her subjects.&nbsp; Her
proclamation prohibited all preaching, until consultation should
be had by parliament.&nbsp; In that assembly she was no less
absolute than elsewhere.&nbsp; The supremacy of the church of
England was again vested in the crown, and a statute <a
name="citation54"></a><a href="#footnote54"
class="citation">[54]</a> passed which was designed to establish
uniformity in religion, and required all persons, having no
lawful or reasonable excuse, to resort to their parish churches,
every Sunday, and on all holidays.</p>
<p>Under the authority of the Act of Supremacy, a court was
erected, called the court of High Commission, which took
cognizance of religious matters, without the aid of a jury.&nbsp;
The liturgy was revised, and rendered more palatable to the <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>papists.&nbsp; The clergy were required to comply with
all the queen&rsquo;s injunctions, and at their entrance on their
cures, publicly to assent to a declaration of articles of
religion, drawn up by the bishops.</p>
<p>Previously to this period, the contest between catholicism and
the reformed faith had absorbed all minor differences of
opinion.&nbsp; But the frequent changes of the national creed,
induced many to consult the Bible for themselves, in order to
ascertain its testimony as to faith and discipline.&nbsp; It was
impossible the humblest capacity should not perceive that, had it
been a part of Christian duty, to conform to the religion
patronised and established by the state, that duty had been
equally imperative in every successive reign.&nbsp; He whose life
had been spared for half a century, must, unless there had been a
strange vacillation in his opinions, or, at least, in his
professions, have been very fortunate to have escaped the doom of
an obstinate heretic.</p>
<p>The <i>exiles</i> of previous reigns had awaked to the
perception of the great truth, that no human authority could
deprive them of the <a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>right, or discharge them from the obligation, of seeking
after God and his true worship.&nbsp; Some of them, availing
themselves of the liberty they enjoyed upon the continent, had
introduced what they deemed a purer, because a more scriptural,
form of worship, than had yet been used in England.&nbsp;
Returning to their native country on the accession of Elizabeth,
they found her little disposed to co-operate with them in
carrying on the reformation.&nbsp; A large portion of the clergy
desired that the services of religion should be retained as near
as possible to the popish form; and those who were favourable to
religious liberty, or contended for further purification of the
service book from the dregs of superstition, received the
contemptuous but honourable name of <i>puritans</i>.&nbsp; These
questioned not the propriety of a secular establishment of
Christianity; but they objected to wearing the popish vestments,
and to various ceremonies derived from the same source. <a
name="citation56"></a><a href="#footnote56"
class="citation">[56]</a>&nbsp; They disapproved of some things
in the public liturgy, <a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>of church festivals, pluralities,
non-residence, and lay patrons; they complained of the want of
godly discipline, and desired to bring both the faith and polity
of the state religion to the test of Scripture. <a
name="citation57"></a><a href="#footnote57"
class="citation">[57]</a>&nbsp; They were eminent for piety and
devotedness to the cause of Christ.&nbsp; To say that their views
of religious liberty were confused and inconsistent, and that
they were themselves intolerant in their temper and conduct, is
only to admit that they did not shake off, at the first effort,
all the errors of the times in which they lived, and that their
course, if it was firm and daring, was not precipitate or
impetuous.&nbsp; They were for going fearlessly as far in the
path of improvement as they could perceive that the inspired
volume invited them: and with a moral magnanimity of which their
persecutors dreaded the effect, they bared their souls before
God, desiring to receive &ldquo;ampler communications and
superior light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Puritanism constituted a sanctuary in which <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>the sacred
rights of conscience were preserved and propagated, while the
high church party had forgotten and forsaken the ground on which
alone a departure from the papal authority could be
maintained.&nbsp; The puritans occupy an intermediate position,
between the first adherents to protestant popery, and the more
enlightened nonconformists of the succeeding century.</p>
<p>They were soon compelled to supply a test of their sincerity
in the sacrifices they made.&nbsp; He who omitted <i>one</i> of
the most unimportant of the enjoined ceremonies, was deemed
&ldquo;guilty of all.&rdquo;&nbsp; The most exemplary ministers
were silenced; while the profane and the unprincipled were
beneficed, upon the sole ground of their unqualified
conformity.</p>
<p>Among many who were suspended in Norfolk and Suffolk, may be
mentioned Mr. Lawrence, an eminent divine, who had been beneficed
in the latter county.&nbsp; When Mr. Calthorpe, &ldquo;a
gentleman of quality,&rdquo; interposed in his behalf, urging the
great want the church had of such men as Mr. Lawrence, whose
fitness for his work, he said, the chief men of credit in the
county would <a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>certify, the bishop pleaded that the queen required him
to allow of no ministers but such as were perfectly conformable.
<a name="citation59a"></a><a href="#footnote59a"
class="citation">[59a]</a></p>
<p>Dr. Crick and Mr. Sanderson, two learned and useful ministers
in Norfolk, and many others in the diocese of Norwich, refusing
conformity, were prosecuted in the ecclesiastical courts. <a
name="citation59b"></a><a href="#footnote59b"
class="citation">[59b]</a></p>
<p>Some of the bishops, <a name="citation59c"></a><a
href="#footnote59c" class="citation">[59c]</a> however,
sanctioned their clergy in setting up religious exercises among
themselves, for the promotion of discipline and the dissemination
of scriptural knowledge.&nbsp; These were called
<i>prophesyings</i>, from the apostolic sentiment, &ldquo;Ye may
all prophesy, one by one, that all may learn, and all may be
comforted.&rdquo; <a name="citation59d"></a><a
href="#footnote59d" class="citation">[59d]</a>&nbsp; They furnish
the original of similar discussions held, at a subsequent period,
among the Brownists, and of which some traces are found in the
Independent Church at Beccles soon after its formation.</p>
<p>The clergy who attended these meetings spoke <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>in succession
upon the interpretation of a given passage of Scripture, and
conferred respecting sound doctrine and a good life.&nbsp; Their
names were written in a table, and three took part in each
exercise.&nbsp; The first opened and closed the meeting with
prayer, and gave his explanation of the text.&nbsp; The other two
added any further explanation of the subject and stated their
objections.&nbsp; At the close of each meeting, the next speaker
was appointed and his subject fixed upon.&nbsp; Those who joined
in these &ldquo;prophesyings&rdquo; signed, on being admitted, a
confession, to the effect that they believed the word of God to
be a perfect rule of faith and manners; that it ought to be read
and known by all; that its authority not only exceeded that of
the pope but of the church also; that they condemned, as a
tyrannous yoke, such articles of faith and fashions of serving
God as men had enjoined without the authority of his word.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And to this word of God (said they) we humbly submit
ourselves and all our doings, willing and ready to be judged,
reformed, or further instructed thereby in all points of
religion.&rdquo; <a name="citation60"></a><a href="#footnote60"
class="citation">[60]</a></p>
<p><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>The
utility of these grave debates early introduced them into the
eastern counties, where they were encouraged by Bishop Parkhurst,
till he received a reprimand from the queen, who insisted upon
their suppression as &ldquo;no better than seminaries of
puritanism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Persecution never fails to foster and spread the principles it
attempts to exterminate.&nbsp; Instead of ceasing altogether, the
conferences of the clergy assumed a more formidable aspect.&nbsp;
Not long afterwards there was an assembly at Mr. Knewstub&rsquo;s
church at Cockfield, near Lavenham, in Suffolk, of sixty
clergymen of that county, Norfolk, and Cambridgeshire.&nbsp; The
subjects for consideration were the Book of Common Prayer, and
the extent to which submission to the ecclesiastical authorities
was allowable.&nbsp; After repeated adjournments they agreed,
that although such of the Articles as contained the sum of
Christian faith and the doctrine of the sacraments might properly
be subscribed, neither the Common Prayer Book, nor the rest of
the Articles, ought; &ldquo;no, though a man should be deprived
of his ministry <a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>for refusing it.&rdquo; <a name="citation62a"></a><a
href="#footnote62a" class="citation">[62a]</a>&nbsp; They were
desirous, however, of introducing a reformation into the church,
without separating from it.</p>
<p>Archbishop Grindal and some other prelates endeavoured to
regulate the &ldquo;prophesyings,&rdquo; by enjoining the
observance of strict order, and by confining them to the
conforming clergy. <a name="citation62b"></a><a
href="#footnote62b" class="citation">[62b]</a>&nbsp; But this
renewed the displeasure of the despotic woman in whose hand, by a
fundamental and fatal error, had been placed the supremacy of the
church of England.&nbsp; &ldquo;By means of these
assemblies,&rdquo; her Majesty observes, writing to the bishop of
London, &ldquo;great numbers of our people, especially of the
<i>vulgar sort</i>, meet to be otherwise occupied with some
honest labour for their living, are brought to idleness, seduced,
and in manners schismatically divided among themselves into a
variety of dangerous opinions.&rdquo;&nbsp; She commanded that
these &ldquo;exercises&rdquo; should be forthwith put down,
adding an order for the imprisonment of such as should refuse
compliance, with a threat of severer punishment, and closing her
<a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>communication by an insolent menace to the bishop
himself. <a name="citation63a"></a><a href="#footnote63a"
class="citation">[63a]</a></p>
<p>Meanwhile, continued oppression induced the ministers of
Norfolk to present to the privy council a supplication, in which,
after many expressions of loyalty to the queen, they add,
&ldquo;Yet we desire that her Majesty will not think us
disobedient, seeing we suffer ourselves to be displaced, rather
than yield to some things required.&nbsp; Our bodies and goods,
and all we have, are in her Majesty&rsquo;s hands; <i>only our
souls we reserve to our God</i>, who alone is able to save us or
condemn us.&rdquo; <a name="citation63b"></a><a
href="#footnote63b" class="citation">[63b]</a></p>
<p>Slaves could not have sued for less; but this was far too
extensive a reservation to be allowed.&nbsp; The pacific Bishop
Parkhurst having been succeeded by Dr. Freke, a man of very
different spirit, seven ministers, in or near Norwich, were soon
afterwards suspended. <a name="citation63c"></a><a
href="#footnote63c" class="citation">[63c]</a></p>
<p>Subsequent years brought no mitigation.&nbsp; Besides other
instances of ecclesiastical molestation in the East Anglian
counties, Mathew Hammond, a poor plough-wright at Hethersett, was
<a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>condemned
by the bishop as a heretic, had his ears cut off, and after the
lapse of a week, was committed, in the castle ditch at Norwich,
to the more agonizing torment of the flames. <a
name="citation64a"></a><a href="#footnote64a"
class="citation">[64a]</a></p>
<p>Many puritan ministers who had livings in Suffolk were
prosecuted for neglect or variations in the performance of the
public service.&nbsp; Upon this some of the justices of the
peace, and other gentry in that county, made a complaint to the
privy council; thus declaring their grievance: &ldquo;We see,
right honourable, by too long and lamentable experience, that the
state of the church (<i>especially in our parts</i>) groweth
every day more sick than other; and they whom it most concerneth
have been so careless in providing the means, as the hope of her
recovery waxeth almost desperate . . . These towers of Zion, the
painful pastors and ministers of the word, by what malice we know
not,&mdash;they are marshalled with the worst malefactors,
presented, indicted, arraigned, and condemned, for matters, as we
presume, of very slender moment.&rdquo; <a
name="citation64b"></a><a href="#footnote64b"
class="citation">[64b]</a>&nbsp; Valuable testimony, since it was
borne by men who, nevertheless, <a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>avowed, in the very same document,
their detestation of the name and heresy of puritanism.</p>
<p>The translation of Dr. Whitgift to the see of Canterbury, <a
name="citation65a"></a><a href="#footnote65a"
class="citation">[65a]</a> was the signal for augmented
rigour.&nbsp; He was charged by the queen to restore religious
uniformity, which she confessed, notwithstanding all her
precautions, had &ldquo;run out of square.&rdquo; <a
name="citation65b"></a><a href="#footnote65b"
class="citation">[65b]</a>&nbsp; Canute had rebuked the profanity
and folly of those who desired him to attempt the repression of
the flowing tide.&nbsp; Elizabeth challenged to herself the right
to bind, with the fetters of a statute, the immortal
spirit.&nbsp; Losing sight of the true nature of religion, and
regarding it only as a piece of state machinery, she sought to
bend it to her despotic will, and wondered that it continually
escaped from her grasp, and scorned her fury.</p>
<p>His Grace forthwith furnished the bishops of his province with
certain articles for the government of their dioceses, by which
all preaching, catechising, and praying in private families,
where <a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>any
were present besides the family, were prohibited; and it was
required, that all preachers should wear the habits prescribed,
and that none should be admitted to preach, or execute any part
of the ecclesiastical function, unless they subscribed the three
following articles:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;1.&nbsp; That the queen hath and ought to have the
sovereignty and rule over all manner of persons born within her
dominions, of what condition soever they be; and that none other
power or potentate hath or ought to have any <i>power</i>,
<i>ecclesiastical</i> or civil, within her realms or
dominions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;2.&nbsp; That the Book of Common Prayer, and of
ordaining bishops, priests, and deacons, <i>containeth nothing
contrary to the word of God</i>, but may be lawfully used, and
that <i>he himself will use the same</i>, <i>and none other</i>,
in public prayer and administration of the sacraments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;3.&nbsp; That he alloweth the Book of Articles agreed
upon in the convocation holden at London in 1562, and set forth
by her Majesty&rsquo;s authority; and he believeth <i>all the
articles</i> <a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>therein contained <i>to be agreeable to the word of
God</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation67a"></a><a href="#footnote67a"
class="citation">[67a]</a></p>
<p>These were called &ldquo;Whitgift&rsquo;s Articles,&rdquo; as
he was their principal author.&nbsp; Subscription to them was
required, for many years, without the warrant of any statute, or
even of any canon.</p>
<p>On the archbishop&rsquo;s primary metropolitan visitation, a
hundred and twenty-four clergymen in Norfolk and Suffolk were
suspended in consequence of the application of this test. <a
name="citation67b"></a><a href="#footnote67b"
class="citation">[67b]</a>&nbsp; Petitions again flowed in from
Norwich and Norfolk, and from other counties.&nbsp; But Whitgift
opposed every degree of relaxation, &ldquo;lest the church should
be thought to have maintained an error;&rdquo; and a new
commission was granted for the detection of nonconformity,
against which even the privy council remonstrated, as a copy of
the Spanish Inquisition. <a name="citation67c"></a><a
href="#footnote67c" class="citation">[67c]</a></p>
<p>A conspicuous agent in this commission was <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>Aylmer,
bishop of London.&nbsp; At one visitation in Essex he suspended
nearly forty ministers.&nbsp; Those who were brought before him,
in his progress through the country, were loaded with invective.
<a name="citation68a"></a><a href="#footnote68a"
class="citation">[68a]</a></p>
<p>Others were summoned, from distant parts of the kingdom, to
appear at St. Paul&rsquo;s, or at Lambeth. <a
name="citation68b"></a><a href="#footnote68b"
class="citation">[68b]</a>&nbsp; The inconvenience and expense of
travelling at that period rendered their case particularly
grievous.&nbsp; They had to answer, upon oath, a string of
interrogatories with which they were previously unacquainted, and
which could not fail to convict the puritan clergyman on his own
testimony. <a name="citation68c"></a><a href="#footnote68c"
class="citation">[68c]</a>&nbsp; Too conscientious to conform in
all points, he scorned to avert the sword of persecution by the
aid of falsehood.&nbsp; If he would have sacrificed his
convictions at the shrine of bigotry, and have signed his name
where his reason refused assent, he might have revelled in the
emoluments of ecclesiastical preferment, although he were</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;a
sot, or dunce,<br />
Lascivious, headstrong, or all these at once.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>But it
was enough to extort from him an admission that he had, in any
<i>one instance</i>, deviated in the slightest particular from
the ceremonies; or that he had said or written, publicly or
privately, aught against the Book of Common Prayer, or <i>any
thing</i> therein contained, as being unscriptural or
<i>inconvenient</i>;&mdash;and although he had evinced the
laborious zeal of Paul, displayed the eloquence of Apollos, and
exemplified the holy benevolence of John, still&mdash;he was a
nonconformist&mdash;he was cast out.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Among those who were suspended for nonconformity at Archbishop
Whitgift&rsquo;s first visitation, was <span
class="smcap">William Fleming</span>, rector of Beccles.</p>
<p>The information which has been preserved respecting him leads
to the conviction that he was a useful and an exemplary man, to a
considerable extent influential and beloved; and respected even
by his enemies.&nbsp; He had enemies.&nbsp; They who congratulate
themselves on having none, have, frequently, cause to inquire
whether they are discharging the duties incumbent upon them as
members of society, with that high regard to <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>principle
which characterized the puritans, and is as remote from the
meanness of indecision as from the rancour of mere party
zeal.</p>
<p>During Mr. Fleming&rsquo;s ministry in Beccles, a warm and
long continued dispute, occurred between the first grantees from
the crown of the tract of marshes already mentioned, <a
name="citation70a"></a><a href="#footnote70a"
class="citation">[70a]</a> and some of the inhabitants.&nbsp; The
grant had been accompanied by extensive powers, which were
employed with little moderation.&nbsp; This was naturally a
source of dissatisfaction, and led to animosities which ended in
a surrender of the property in question to the queen. <a
name="citation70b"></a><a href="#footnote70b"
class="citation">[70b]</a>&nbsp; The incorporating of the
&ldquo;portreeve, surveyors, and commonalty of the Fen of
Beccles,&rdquo; was the result; an arrangement which met with
considerable opposition, from a person named Harsault and
others.&nbsp; The plan, however, was probably approved by the
more judicious inhabitants, as calculated, in the <i>then
existing</i> state of things, to preclude the evils of <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>either a
narrower or a broader system of municipal government.&nbsp; Mr.
Fleming appears to have lent his influence in support of the new
charter.</p>
<p>A commission was issued to Sir Robert Wingfield and others, to
attempt an arrangement of these differences.&nbsp; The
commissioners met accordingly, at Beccles, and made a return, in
which, after expressing their persuasion that the government of
the town was likely to proceed in peace, they add: &ldquo;And
furder, whereas by vertue of the same yor ho: letters we are
directed to th&rsquo; examynac&rsquo;on of certeyn trobles and
molestac&rsquo;ons brought upon one Mr. Flemyng, the minister
there; we fynde the man to be <i>of verie good desert bothe
concerning life and doctryne</i>, <i>and to have p&rsquo;fited
the peple there verie greatly</i>, yet had he ben much trobled by
some sorrie instruments issueing from the same spring as we take
it; for having hym and them before us, they alledged no cause of
offence, but rather iustified the man, and reconciled themselves
to hym, except one Harsault, whome we fownde factious, and a man
utterlie unworthye of eny <a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>good allowance or regarde emongst his
honest neighbors.&rdquo; <a name="citation72a"></a><a
href="#footnote72a" class="citation">[72a]</a></p>
<p>There was, however, one offence of which Mr. Fleming was found
guilty.&nbsp; He did not conform in all points to the prescribed
ritual.&nbsp; Urged in extenuation of this, the pains of a
doubting or the convictions of a settled judgment, the testimony
of a good life and the profession of sound doctrine, the
attachment of his flock and the usefulness of his
ministry&mdash;were, in the estimation of the intolerant
ecclesiastics, of no value.&nbsp; He was summoned to London <a
name="citation72b"></a><a href="#footnote72b"
class="citation">[72b]</a> to undergo the mockery of an
examination, and to sustain the costs of his journey, and the
ultimate loss of his preferment.</p>
<p>Mr. Fleming refused to subscribe Whitgift&rsquo;s Articles;
and the discipline of the ecclesiastical courts having been
employed in vain in his correction, the bishop, on the 23rd of
July, 1584, deprived him of his living. <a
name="citation72c"></a><a href="#footnote72c"
class="citation">[72c]</a>&nbsp; He continued to <a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>reside in
Beccles, probably exercising privately the most essential
branches of a minister&rsquo;s duty, if not, after a time,
officiating in the parish church through the connivance of those
who were conscious <a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>of his value. <a name="citation74a"></a><a
href="#footnote74a" class="citation">[74a]</a>&nbsp; He died in
1613; and his interment, on the 8th of September in that year, is
recorded in the parochial register in terms which prove that time
had not sullied the reputation which persecution had failed to
injure, and that when the grave had closed over his remains, he
was remembered as the benefactor of his neighbours, and honoured
as the founder of a new order of christian ministers among
them.&nbsp; The entry, in the oldest register book now preserved,
stands thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Bury: Master William Fleming, our minister
and faythfull teacher, the glory of our towne, &amp; father of
y<sup>e</sup> ministery round about us.&rdquo; <a
name="citation74b"></a><a href="#footnote74b"
class="citation">[74b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the terms in which the above entry is couched, it seems
that Mr. Fleming was the first clergyman in Beccles who had
cordially embraced <a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>and advocated the doctrines of the Reformation. <a
name="citation75"></a><a href="#footnote75"
class="citation">[75]</a>&nbsp; He had carried out its great
principle to an extent which marks him as the father of the
protestant <i>dissenting</i> ministry in that place.&nbsp; What
were the precise objections made by him to the archbishop&rsquo;s
Articles, is unknown.&nbsp; But the nonconformity of Beccles will
appear to have been justifiable in its <i>origin</i>, if it be
shown that those Articles embraced any point to which, as an
upright man, he could not unhesitatingly assent.</p>
<p>It will be recollected that by them he was required solemnly
to acknowledge the queen&rsquo;s <i>ecclesiastical</i> supremacy;
and to declare that the authorized ritual contained <span
class="GutSmall">NOTHING</span> contrary to the word of God; that
he would use it <i>and none other</i> in the public service; and
that he believed <span class="GutSmall">ALL</span> the
Thirty-nine Articles to be agreeable to the word of God.&nbsp;
There was no room for evasion, no saving or qualifying
clause.&nbsp; However trivial or indifferent the ceremony
respecting which conscience paused, still, as nothing <a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>is trivial
when truth and conscience are concerned, he could not with
propriety subscribe.&nbsp; His apparent worldly interest and his
desire for usefulness would naturally give him a bias towards
conformity, and he would lament that matters so unimportant
should be imposed as essential terms of preferment; but to have
yielded, would have been to have climbed into the fold of Christ
over the barrier of truth, to have held his living by the tenure
of a solemn and deliberate falsehood.</p>
<p>It is probable that he did not altogether deny the
ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the queen; though cruelty was
already leading many to the conviction that human authority had
no proper place in the administration of the kingdom of
Christ.&nbsp; But, like the puritans in general, he was, no
doubt, deeply impressed with the unscriptural character of
popery, and with the mischievous tendency of cherishing any
remnant of its idolatrous abominations.&nbsp; The arguments
employed against the ceremonies which had been abolished,
applied, with equal force, to some which had been retained.&nbsp;
The sign of the cross in baptism, the use of the <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>surplice,
bowing to the east, and kneeling before the table of the Lord,
were as devoid of warrant in the Bible, as the ceremony of
following the cross in procession, the use of holy water, ashes,
and palms, or the worship of the sacramental wafer.&nbsp; The
bishops in the earlier part of Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign, had
looked upon the catholic rites, which had been allowed to creep
into the protestant church, as having been only tolerated for a
time, and as a blot upon the Reformation, to be wiped off as soon
as circumstances would admit. <a name="citation77a"></a><a
href="#footnote77a" class="citation">[77a]</a>&nbsp; On the
contrary, they were now held up as, each and all of them,
essential to the uniformity of religion, and indispensable to the
authorized performance of her public services.&nbsp; If Mr.
Fleming deemed any one of them contrary to Scripture, as not
being conducive to edification, but rather causing offence, <a
name="citation77b"></a><a href="#footnote77b"
class="citation">[77b]</a> he could not honestly put his
signature to the archbishop&rsquo;s Articles.</p>
<p>Turning over, with anxiety and thoughtfulness, the pages of
the Book of Common Prayer, to <a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>which he was called upon to give so
uncompromising an approval, he may be supposed to have noticed
such particulars as the following.</p>
<p>The Creed attributed to Athanasius in effect declared it
essential to salvation, not only that the mysterious doctrines of
the Trinity and the incarnation of Christ should be believed, but
that the <i>explanation</i> therein attempted of those doctrines
should be embraced as &ldquo;the right faith;&rdquo; and it
denounced the sentence of eternal condemnation against those who
did not &ldquo;thus think,&rdquo; with a peremptoriness and
reiteration amounting to a virtual claim of infallibility.&nbsp;
But if he could not discover in the Sacred Records any such
explanation of the doctrines in question, nor, consequently, any
such conditions of salvation, he might hesitate to declare his
belief that those harsh clauses were not at variance with the
word of God.</p>
<p>In the Baptism of Infants he would perceive that the priest
was required to declare the baptized child to be
<i>regenerated</i>, and to return thanks to God for so great a
blessing.&nbsp; And he might think the doctrine obviously implied
in <a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>that
form, and plainly expressed in the catechism which follows it,
&ldquo;contrary to the word of God,&rdquo; which treats of
regeneration as a change of heart, such as no outward ceremony
could confer. <a name="citation79a"></a><a href="#footnote79a"
class="citation">[79a]</a></p>
<p>In the Catechism also, the Common Prayer Book taught that
there were two sacraments &ldquo;generally <i>necessary</i> to
salvation,&rdquo; whereas he might conceive that it was
&ldquo;contrary to the word of God&rdquo; to make such an
assertion respecting either of them, in any instance. <a
name="citation79b"></a><a href="#footnote79b"
class="citation">[79b]</a></p>
<p>In the Order for the Visitation of the Sick, the priest was
directed to assume authority to &ldquo;absolve&rdquo; the
penitent sinner: but while he was required to subscribe, as
perfectly scriptural, the volume containing that formulary,
conscience <a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>might be demanding, who can forgive sins but God alone?
<a name="citation80a"></a><a href="#footnote80a"
class="citation">[80a]</a></p>
<p>Perhaps Mr. Fleming might apprehend that it was
&ldquo;contrary to the word of God,&rdquo; which enjoins
faithfulness in ministers, and sincerity in all, <a
name="citation80b"></a><a href="#footnote80b"
class="citation">[80b]</a> to adopt indiscriminately, with
reference to all who were not unbaptized, excommunicated, or
suicides, the form for the Burial of the Dead.&nbsp; He would
gladly have availed himself, it may be, always of some portions,
and frequently, of the whole of that beautiful and impressive
service, if he might have been excused from expressing alike over
the saint and the reviler of holiness&mdash;over him who had
embraced and him who had denied the creed which all were required
to receive as expounded by the church on pain of eternal
death&mdash;over him who had calmly died in the well-grounded
hope of acceptance at the bar of God, and him who had been
hurried to that bar from scenes of intemperance or
brawling&mdash;the same &ldquo;<i>sure and certain</i> <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>hope&rdquo;
of the resurrection of the deceased to eternal life; and if he
had not been called upon, however depraved and hopeless the
character of the departed, or however irreparable the breach in
society occasioned by his removal, to give Almighty God thanks
for taking him to Himself&mdash;thanks which the lip must profess
to be &ldquo;hearty,&rdquo; but to which the heart, in the utmost
stretch of charity in the one case, or of self-denial in the
other, could not respond.</p>
<p>The version of the Psalms incorporated with the Book of Common
Prayer, differed in many respects from that in the authorized
version of the Bible, and in one instance directly contradicted
it. <a name="citation81"></a><a href="#footnote81"
class="citation">[81]</a>&nbsp; He, therefore, who acknowledged
the more recent version as the word of God, and had noticed the
discrepancy, could not, with strict truth, profess his conviction
that the Prayer Book contained <i>nothing</i> contrary to the
word of God.</p>
<p>Again: one of the Thirty-nine Articles expressly affirmed that
&ldquo;Christ went down into <a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>hell.&rdquo;&nbsp; If Mr. Fleming was
not at liberty to assign to this language a meaning such as the
words, in the plain literal sense, do not express, and such as
the compilers did not intend to convey, he might naturally feel
some difficulty in admitting the statement to be &ldquo;agreeable
to the word of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another of the Articles asserted that Christ rose from death,
&ldquo;and took again his body with <i>flesh</i>, <i>bones</i>,
and all things appertaining to the perfection of man&rsquo;s
nature; wherewith he ascended into heaven, and there sitteth
<i>until</i> he return <i>to judge</i> all men at the last
day.&rdquo;&nbsp; But a contemplative mind, accustomed to bring
all its speculations to the test of holy writ, might be ready to
assent to the proposition that there is a sense in which the
glorified body of Christ is identical with that in which he
tabernacled on earth, and yet might venture to doubt whether the
language of that Article was altogether &ldquo;agreeable to the
word of God,&rdquo; in which the distinction is so clearly marked
between the &ldquo;natural&rdquo; and the &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo;
body; between that which is sown in corruption, dishonour, and <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>weakness, and
that which is raised in incorruption, glory, and power; and in
which it is expressly asserted that &ldquo;flesh and blood cannot
inherit the kingdom of God.&rdquo; <a name="citation83"></a><a
href="#footnote83" class="citation">[83]</a>&nbsp; Nor could the
concluding words of this Article be regarded as having the
warrant of Scripture, by any who were looking for the millennial
reign of Christ upon earth.</p>
<p>It is possible that the &ldquo;penance,&rdquo; prescribed by
another of the Articles as requisite to the restoration of an
excommunicated person, would appear to some, to be more consonant
with the genius of popery, but less &ldquo;agreeable to the word
of God,&rdquo; than that <i>penitence</i>, without which the garb
or the posture of humiliation could avail nothing.</p>
<p>Or, (not to multiply instances further,) perhaps Mr. Fleming
was an admirer of instrumental music in public worship, and
believed it to have the warrant of Scripture.&nbsp; But by the
thirty-fifth Article it is declared that the homilies contained
&ldquo;a godly and wholesome doctrine,&rdquo; although one branch
of the doctrine comprised <a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>therein was, that &ldquo;chaunting
and playing upon organs displeased God sore, and filthily defiled
his holy house.&rdquo; <a name="citation84"></a><a
href="#footnote84" class="citation">[84]</a></p>
<p>In the above statement, no account has been taken of the
invasion of Christ&rsquo;s authority and of his people&rsquo;s
freedom, implied in the requirement of subscription to <i>any</i>
human formulary.&nbsp; Nor is it intended to rest the argument
upon the most formidable objections to the Common Prayer Book of
the English church in particular.&nbsp; Some of those objections
relate to doctrines so momentous, sanctioned under circumstances
so peculiarly solemn, as to relieve the dissentient altogether
from the suspicion of captious trifling.</p>
<p>But it is submitted to the consideration of the candid reader,
whether any hesitancy existing in the mind of a minister of the
gospel, on any one of these, or any similar point, would not be
enough to justify his declining, at whatever apparent sacrifice
of usefulness or emolument, to give his deliberate assent to the
propositions contained <a name="page85"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 85</span>in Whitgift&rsquo;s Articles.&nbsp;
The law of sincerity binds not to a partial but to a universal
obedience.&nbsp; A deep reverence for truth, and a peculiarly
tender conscience, are obviously just the qualities most likely
to have insured a refusal.&nbsp; Cruel and mischievous indeed
must have been the policy which thus demanded an unqualified
acquiescence in so heterogeneous a mass of propositions, holding
out a premium to the temporizing and careless to fritter away the
eternal boundaries of right and wrong. <a
name="citation85"></a><a href="#footnote85"
class="citation">[85]</a></p>
<p>If the separation which took place among the professed
Christians of Beccles at this early period may be designated a
schism, the charge <a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>does not attach to Mr. Fleming, and those who, probably,
seceded with him, but to the parties by whom they were
rejected.&nbsp; &ldquo;Schism is a thing bad in itself, bad in
its very nature; separation may be bad or good according to
circumstances.&rdquo;&nbsp; Separation is not necessarily schism;
&ldquo;for while it may be occasioned by crime, it may be
occasioned by virtue; it may result in those who depart from
intolerance attempted, or intolerance sustained, from the pride
of faction, or the predominance of principle, attachment to
party, or attachment to truth.&nbsp; A schismatic, in short,
<i>must</i> be a sinner, on whichever side he stands; a
separatist <i>may</i> be more sinned against than sinning.&rdquo;
<a name="citation86"></a><a href="#footnote86"
class="citation">[86]</a></p>
<p>Mr. Fleming was a separatist, he was so by compulsion; but he
was not a schismatic: and protestant dissent in Beccles was pure
in its source; for it must in justice be traced not to a factious
disobedience to the higher powers, but to an act of moral
heroism, elicited by the despotism of Queen Elizabeth and the
severity of a protestant archbishop.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> early puritans, in general,
were strongly attached to the principle of a national established
church.&nbsp; But some of them were at length prompted, by their
sad experience of episcopal domination, openly to seek the
substitution of presbyterianism, as a form of church government
which promised to preserve the equality of christian ministers,
while it maintained their connexion and their authority.&nbsp;
Others conceived that if episcopacy trampled on the scriptural
rights of the clergy, presbyterianism interfered with <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>those of the
laity, and that both invaded the authority of Christ. <a
name="citation88a"></a><a href="#footnote88a"
class="citation">[88a]</a>&nbsp; Convictions of this nature
flashed across the active mind of a young clergyman named Robert
Brown.&nbsp; In 1581, he attracted the notice of Bishop Freke, as
a teacher of &ldquo;strange and dangerous doctrine&rdquo; at Bury
St. Edmunds, where he received so much encouragement, and his
opinions were spreading so rapidly, as (in the serious
apprehension of the bishop) to &ldquo;hazard the overthrow of all
religion.&rdquo; <a name="citation88b"></a><a href="#footnote88b"
class="citation">[88b]</a></p>
<p>The Brownists differed little from the Church of England in
their doctrinal views; but they looked upon her discipline as
popish and antichristian, her sacraments and ordinances as
invalid; and renounced communion with every church that was not
constituted on the same model as their own.&nbsp; They held that
as the primitive faith was to be maintained, so also the
primitive institutions, as delineated in the New Testament, were
to be imitated; and that every congregation of <a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>believers
was, according to the Scriptures, a church in itself, having full
power to elect, ordain, and dismiss its own pastor and other
officers; to admit or exclude members; and to manage all its
affairs, without being accountable to any other human
jurisdiction.&nbsp; They discarded all forms of prayer.&nbsp; As
they did not allow the priesthood to be a distinct order, the
laity had full liberty to &ldquo;prophesy,&rdquo; or exhort, in
their assemblies, and it was usual, after sermon, for some of the
members to propose questions and confer upon the doctrines that
had been delivered. <a name="citation89"></a><a
href="#footnote89" class="citation">[89]</a>&nbsp; They were
careful respecting the religious character of those who united
with them in church fellowship.&nbsp; Thus their views embraced
the substance of those entertained by the Independents of the
present day.&nbsp; But the Brownists introduced into their
&ldquo;first rude sketch,&rdquo; some opinions <a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>which have
since been modified by the steady hand of wisdom, and some
practices which have been expunged as unsanctioned by
Scripture.&nbsp; They lost sight, too, of that which constituted
the glory of their system, that its leading principle forbad the
assumption of infallibility, while it provided the best security
for the correction of whatever was erroneous in the scheme they
had adopted, and for the preservation of all that was according
to the will of God.</p>
<p>Brown took refuge from persecution at Middleburg, in Zealand;
but soon returned to England, and ultimately renounced those
principles of nonconformity, which he was better fitted to
develope by his ardour, than to recommend by his character.</p>
<p>The flame which he had kindled continued to burn with a purer,
a steadier, and a broader lustre.&nbsp; In the parliament which
met in February 1592&ndash;3, Sir Walter Raleigh said he feared
there were near twenty thousand Brownists divided into
congregations in Norfolk and Essex and in the neighbourhood of
London. <a name="citation90"></a><a href="#footnote90"
class="citation">[90]</a>&nbsp; Even this enlightened <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>statesman
declared that he deemed them &ldquo;worthy to be rooted out of a
commonwealth;&rdquo; and the parliament, which had often shown a
disposition to favour the puritans, consented, with a view to the
extermination of the Brownists, to pass an act characterized by
consummate tyranny.&nbsp; It consigned to prison all, above
sixteen years of age, who should forbear for a month to go to
church, or who should deny the queen&rsquo;s ecclesiastical
authority.&nbsp; And in case they refused to make a most
degrading submission, they were to go into perpetual banishment;
and such as remained beyond the specified time, or returned
without license from the queen, were to suffer death as felons.
<a name="citation91"></a><a href="#footnote91"
class="citation">[91]</a></p>
<p>The Brownists felt the full weight of this cruel law.&nbsp;
The justices of Suffolk who petitioned the council in favour of
the puritan clergy, had no mercy for such audacious heretics as
these.&nbsp; &ldquo;We allow not&rdquo; (said they) &ldquo;of the
anabaptists and their communion; we allow not of Brown, the
overthrower of church and commonwealth; <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>we abhor all
these; we punish all these.&rdquo; <a name="citation92a"></a><a
href="#footnote92a" class="citation">[92a]</a>&nbsp; Many were
imprisoned; some were hanged; multitudes were driven to the
protestant states on the continent.&nbsp; Others remained at home
&ldquo;fluctuating between the evasion and violation of the
law,&rdquo; and casting a wistful glance towards the expected
accession of a prince educated in the presbyterian Kirk of
Scotland. <a name="citation92b"></a><a href="#footnote92b"
class="citation">[92b]</a></p>
<p>They had formed an estimate of James&rsquo;s character, of
which it was eminently undeserving.&nbsp; When the demise of the
queen brought him to the English metropolis, he was met by a
petition from the puritan clergy (popularly called the
<i>millenary</i> petition) for the reformation of ceremonies and
abuses in the church.&nbsp; The signatures to this document were
obtained in twenty-five counties of England.&nbsp; They amounted
to a less number than the name implied, and Suffolk supplied
<i>seventy-one</i>, while the highest number from any other
county was fifty-seven. <a name="citation92c"></a><a
href="#footnote92c" class="citation">[92c]</a>&nbsp; The
petitioners learned the fate of their application, when at the
conclusion <a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>of a conference the king had appointed to be held at
Hampton Court, he declared that they should conform, or he would
&ldquo;hurry them out of the kingdom, or do worse.&rdquo;&nbsp;
James fell an easy prey to the adulation of the English bishops,
and was soon converted to a church of which he found he could be
&ldquo;supreme head.&rdquo;&nbsp; While he thus revived and
pronounced the claim of infallibility, Whitgift echoed the
language employed by the pope on a former occasion, declaring
that &ldquo;undoubtedly his majesty spake by the special
assistance of God&rsquo;s Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The archbishop died soon after, and was succeeded by Dr.
Richard Bancroft, who &ldquo;trod in the steps of his predecessor
in all the iniquities of persecution.&rdquo; <a
name="citation93a"></a><a href="#footnote93a"
class="citation">[93a]</a></p>
<p>In the second year of King James&rsquo;s reign three hundred
ministers were deprived, imprisoned, or banished.&nbsp; Persons
were subjected to fine and imprisonment, for barely repeating to
their families, in the evening, what they had heard at church,
during the day, under the pretence that this constituted the
crime of irregular preaching. <a name="citation93b"></a><a
href="#footnote93b" class="citation">[93b]</a></p>
<p><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>Mr.
Maunsell, minister of Yarmouth, and Mr. Lad, a merchant of the
same place, were cited before the High Commission at Lambeth, for
holding a supposed conventicle, and cast into prison.&nbsp;
Nicholas Fuller, a learned bencher of Gray&rsquo;s Inn, appeared
as their counsel when they were brought to the bar; for which
crime he also was consigned to prison, where he lay to the end of
his days. <a name="citation94"></a><a href="#footnote94"
class="citation">[94]</a></p>
<p>Among those who were proscribed and exiled for professing the
Brownist tenets, were Mr. John Robinson, and Mr. Henry Jacob.</p>
<p>Mr. Robinson had been educated in the University of Cambridge,
and beneficed near Great Yarmouth, in which neighbourhood he had
also a separate congregation.&nbsp; They assembled in private
houses for seven or eight years; but disturbance from the
bishop&rsquo;s officers, and ruinous proceedings in the
ecclesiastical courts, induced them to remove to the
continent.&nbsp; Mr. Robinson settled at Leyden.&nbsp; He had
commenced his career a rigid Brownist; but a more extensive
acquaintance with the world, and the conversation <a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>of learned
men, particularly Dr. William Ames, an exile also for religion,
rendered him more charitable and moderate. <a
name="citation95a"></a><a href="#footnote95a"
class="citation">[95a]</a>&nbsp; He struck out a middle course
between the Brownists and Presbyterians.&nbsp; Maintaining the
lawfulness of separation from the reformed churches, he did not
deny that they were true churches: and while he contended that
each christian society was invested with power to choose
officers, administer the gospel ordinances, and exercise all
needful discipline over its members, and that it was consequently
<i>independent</i> of all classes and synods; he nevertheless
admitted the expediency of grave assemblies among the elders of
churches for the purposes of mutual friendly advice. <a
name="citation95b"></a><a href="#footnote95b"
class="citation">[95b]</a>&nbsp; Mr. Robinson recommended his
sentiments by a character in which eminent faculties and
attainments were crowned and encircled by the predominating power
of a solemn and affectionate piety. <a name="citation95c"></a><a
href="#footnote95c" class="citation">[95c]</a>&nbsp; The
Independents generally regard him as the father of their
sect.&nbsp; But since they claim for their sentiments <a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>a yet nobler
origin, they have preferred to be designated by the terms
<i>Congregational</i> or <i>Independent</i>; as indicating the
point of church government in which they so materially differ
from all who acknowledge the authority of bishops or a
presbytery.</p>
<p>Robinson, though distinguished by moderation, was not
deficient in vigilance.&nbsp; After some years, his congregation
began to be removed by death, and their children to form
connexions with Dutch families.&nbsp; There was ground to
apprehend that their church, few in number, might gradually be
melted away into an irreligious population.&nbsp; No
encouragement was afforded to return home; and after spending
many days in solemn addresses to Heaven for direction, they
formed the sublime resolution of transplanting themselves to the
shores of America, &ldquo;where they might enjoy liberty of
conscience&rdquo; with a more cheering prospect of propagating
their principles.&nbsp; It was arranged that a part of them
should first embark, and that their pastor and the rest should
afterwards follow.&nbsp; A day of fasting and prayer was
appointed; and Mr. Robinson preached, concluding his discourse <a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>with an
exhortation which breathes a spirit of candour far in advance of
the age in which he lived, and strenuously enforces the principle
upon which the religious system of the protestant nonconformists
is founded, and with which it must, ultimately, either sink into
oblivion, or win its way to universal prevalence.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Brethren,&rdquo; said this truly venerable
man, &ldquo;we are now quickly to part from one another, and
whether I may ever live to see your faces on earth any more the
God of heaven only knows; <a name="citation97"></a><a
href="#footnote97" class="citation">[97]</a> but whether the Lord
has appointed that or no, I charge you before God and his blessed
angels, that you follow me no farther than you have seen me
follow the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If God reveal any thing to you by any other instrument
of his, be as ready to receive it, as ever you were to receive
any truth by my ministry; for I am verily persuaded, I am very
confident, the Lord has more truth yet to break out of his holy
word . . . I beseech you, remember it, &rsquo;tis <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>an article in
your church covenant, that you be <i>ready to receive whatever
truth shall be made known to you from the written word of
God</i>.&nbsp; Remember that, and every other article of your
sacred covenant.&nbsp; But I must here withal exhort you to take
heed what you receive as truth.&nbsp; Examine it; consider it;
and compare it with other scriptures of truth, before you receive
it; for &rsquo;tis not possible the christian world should come
so lately out of antichristian darkness, and that perfection of
knowledge should break forth at once.&rdquo; <a

class="citation">[98a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Robinson accompanied the adventurers to Delfthaven, and
kneeling on the sea-shore committed them, in fervent prayer, to
the protection and blessing of Heaven. <a

<p>It is difficult to conceive of an expedition more truly noble
and momentous in its objects and results.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Bright jewels of the mine?<br />
The wealth of seas? the spoils of war?&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; They sought a faith&rsquo;s pure shrine.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Jacob, who has been mentioned as another of the exiled
Brownists, had adopted their creed, without their
uncharitableness; and during his residence on the continent,
embraced Mr. Robinson&rsquo;s views, of church government.&nbsp;
In 1616 he returned to London, and there planted the first
Independent church in England.&nbsp; In this step he had the
sanction of the leading puritans of those times.</p>
<p>Several of his friends who were desirous of uniting in church
fellowship having assembled with him, a day of fasting and prayer
for a blessing upon their undertaking was observed; and each
individual, towards the close of the solemnity, made a public
confession of his faith in Jesus Christ.&nbsp; Then standing
together, they joined hands, and solemnly covenanted with each
other to walk together in all the ways and ordinances God had
already revealed or should further make <a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>known to
them.&nbsp; Mr. Jacob was chosen their pastor by the suffrage of
the brotherhood, and proper persons were appointed as deacons,
with fasting and prayer, and imposition of hands. <a
name="citation100"></a><a href="#footnote100"
class="citation">[100]</a></p>
<p>The policy of the king, alike despotic, bigoted, and weak,
continued to expatriate many of the best of his subjects, and
swelled the ranks of the Independents at home.&nbsp; By the
advice of the bishops his Majesty issued directions that none
should be allowed to preach without perfect conformity, and that
no preacher should maintain any point of doctrine not allowed in
the church of England; a requirement utterly irreconcileable with
his subsequent patronage of the Arminian tenets.</p>
<p>By the millenary petition the puritans had prayed &ldquo;that
the Lord&rsquo;s day be not profaned;&rdquo; and James, taking an
atrocious advantage of their regard to the sanctity of the
sabbath, published, to prevent the spread of their opinions, the
&ldquo;Declaration for sports on the Lord&rsquo;s day,&rdquo;
commonly called <i>The Book of Sports</i>.</p>
<p><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>This
equally profane and ridiculous document originated, as his
Majesty declared, from the prohibition of Sunday recreations by
some &ldquo;puritans and precise people;&rdquo; from which
&ldquo;unlawful carriages&rdquo; there flowed, according to the
royal doctrine, two main evils, the hindering the conversion of
many from popery, and the preventing the meaner sort of people
from using such exercises as would render their bodies fit for
war, when his Majesty might &ldquo;have occasion to <i>use</i>
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; He therefore announced his pleasure, that all
the &ldquo;puritans and precisians&rdquo; should be constrained
to conform, or to leave the country; and that, after divine
service, the people should not be discouraged in any
<i>lawful</i> recreation, such as dancing, archery, leaping; nor
from May-games, Whitson-ales, morris-dances, and the setting up
May-poles, and other sports therewith used. <a
name="citation101"></a><a href="#footnote101"
class="citation">[101]</a></p>
<p>The clergy were required to publish this
&ldquo;Declaration&rdquo; in all parish churches.&nbsp; Many who
refused to do so were brought into the high <a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>commission
court, suspended and imprisoned. <a name="citation102a"></a><a
href="#footnote102a" class="citation">[102a]</a></p>
<p>Dr. Samuel Harsnet, who was translated in 1619 from the see of
Chichester to that of Norwich, was a zealous assertor of the
ceremonies of the church, <a name="citation102b"></a><a
href="#footnote102b" class="citation">[102b]</a> and a bitter
enemy to all &ldquo;irregularities.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Peck, having
catechised his family and sung a psalm in his own house when
several of his neighbours were present, the bishop required them
all to do penance and recant.&nbsp; Those who refused were
immediately excommunicated, and condemned in heavy costs.&nbsp;
The citizens of Norwich afterwards complained to parliament of
this cruel oppression. <a name="citation102c"></a><a
href="#footnote102c" class="citation">[102c]</a></p>
<p>By the same prelate, an individual named Whiting, was
prosecuted and brought before the high commission, expecting to
be deprived of considerable estates; but the death of the king
put an end to the prosecution. <a name="citation102d"></a><a
href="#footnote102d" class="citation">[102d]</a></p>
<p><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>When
Charles the first succeeded to the throne many of the descendants
of the early puritans still adhered to the established church,
seeking only the reduction of the inordinate power of the
bishops, and the removal of &ldquo;popish
ceremonies.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the injuries they received were
constantly stimulating their inquiries, and strengthening their
objections to episcopacy.&nbsp; Dr. Laud, who was successively
promoted from the bishopric of Bath and Wells, to the see of
London, <a name="citation103a"></a><a href="#footnote103a"
class="citation">[103a]</a> and the archbishopric of Canterbury,
<a name="citation103b"></a><a href="#footnote103b"
class="citation">[103b]</a> wielded the terrors of the star
chamber and high commission courts with redoubled cruelty.&nbsp;
New and more offensive rites were introduced into the
church.&nbsp; The communion table was converted into an altar,
and all persons were commanded to bow to it on entering the
church. <a name="citation103c"></a><a href="#footnote103c"
class="citation">[103c]</a>&nbsp; All week-day lectures, and
afternoon sermons on Sundays, were abolished; and the king,
&ldquo;out of pious care for the service of God, and for
suppressing humours that oppose truth,&rdquo; republished, by the
advice of his ecclesiastical favourite, the Book of Sports, with
a command that it should <a name="page104"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>be read in all parish churches. <a
name="citation104a"></a><a href="#footnote104a"
class="citation">[104a]</a>&nbsp; This the puritan clergy
refused, for which they felt the iron rod of their
oppressors.</p>
<p>Another grievance under which the puritans laboured at this
period, arose from the power assumed by the bishops, (in manifest
dereliction both of the canons of the church and the laws of the
land,) of framing and enforcing Articles of Visitation in their
own names.&nbsp; The Articles of Dr. Matthew Wren, bishop of
Norwich, were among the most remarkable.&nbsp; They consisted of
nearly nine hundred questions, some very insignificant, others
highly tinctured with superstition, and several impossible to be
answered. <a name="citation104b"></a><a href="#footnote104b"
class="citation">[104b]</a>&nbsp; They appear to have been
chiefly designed to detect such ministers as were not
&ldquo;perfect&rdquo; conformists&mdash;inquiring minutely into
the observance of the ceremonies, the reading of the Book of
Sports, the practice of conversing upon religion at table, and in
families, &amp;c. <a name="citation104c"></a><a
href="#footnote104c" class="citation">[104c]</a>&nbsp; By his
severities this prelate drove upwards of three thousand persons
to seek their bread in a foreign land. <a
name="citation104d"></a><a href="#footnote104d"
class="citation">[104d]</a></p>
<p><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>Among
many who refused to read the Book of Sports, and otherwise
disobeyed some of the bishop&rsquo;s Articles, was Mr. William
Bridge, who had been a fellow of Emanuel College, Cambridge, and
was parish chaplain of St. George&rsquo;s, Tombland, Norwich. <a
name="citation105a"></a><a href="#footnote105a"
class="citation">[105a]</a>&nbsp; He was silenced, and afterwards
excommunicated.&nbsp; The writ <i>de excommunicato capiendo</i>,
having been issued against him, he withdrew into Holland. <a
name="citation105b"></a><a href="#footnote105b"
class="citation">[105b]</a>&nbsp; An Independent church of
English refugees, at Rotterdam, chose him as their pastor, and,
during his residence among them, he appears to have become firmly
attached to the Congregational mode of church government. <a
name="citation105c"></a><a href="#footnote105c"
class="citation">[105c]</a></p>
<p>The forbearance of the English nation at last broke beneath
the despotism of a king, who, not content with governing by a
parliament, desired <a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>to rule without one, and the cruelty
of a hierarchy which had become a hideous contrast to the church
of the &ldquo;holy, harmless, and undefiled&rdquo;
Redeemer.&nbsp; On the assembling of the long parliament in 1640,
a storm of righteous retribution fell upon the authors of the
ecclesiastical oppressions.&nbsp; The people assailed the
parliament with complaints; the parliament presented their
grievances to the king; and the deluded monarch replied by a
proclamation, requiring an exact conformity to the established
religion!&nbsp; But tyranny had already reached its height, and
the torrent had set in an opposite direction.</p>
<p>The Independents, who had assembled in private, and shifted
from house to house for many years, took courage and showed
themselves in public.&nbsp; The same promising appearances
induced Mr. Bridge to return to England in 1642.&nbsp; Many
families of refugees accompanied him, some of whom settled in
Yarmouth, and others went to reside at Norwich.&nbsp; All of them
appear to have been warmly attached to Mr. Bridge, and very
desirous of continuing under his pastoral care.&nbsp; This
however was highly inconvenient, and it <a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>was at
length agreed that the seat of his church should be at Yarmouth,
and that the residents at Norwich, with some other serious
persons there, should form themselves into a separate
communion.&nbsp; This was done June 10th, 1644, several of the
Yarmouth brethren signifying their consent with expressions of
the most tender and endeared affection, as having been, many of
them, &ldquo;companions together in the patience of our Lord
Jesus, in their own, and in a strange land, and having long
enjoyed sweet communion together in divine ordinances.&rdquo; <a
name="citation107"></a><a href="#footnote107"
class="citation">[107]</a></p>
<p>Mr. Bridge may be regarded as the founder of the Independent
churches in the East Anglian counties.&nbsp; A constant
intercourse had been maintained between those counties and the
opposite coast of Holland, from whence they were not too remote
to catch the spirit of religious freedom which had actuated the
conduct, and which constituted the reward of the exiled
Christians.&nbsp; A district so situated&mdash;the scene of
Robinson&rsquo;s usefulness and sufferings, and which had given
birth to Goodwin and Ames, and was receiving <a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>back into
its bosom the champions of liberty and truth&mdash;presented an
encouraging field for disseminating the principles of
Independency.&nbsp; Hence they were rapidly and extensively
embraced in this part of the kingdom.&nbsp; Dr. Calamy intimates
that, some years after Mr. Bridge&rsquo;s return, &ldquo;most
professors of religion&rdquo; in these counties &ldquo;inclined
to the Congregational way.&rdquo; <a name="citation108a"></a><a
href="#footnote108a" class="citation">[108a]</a></p>
<p>It was not, however, till after the monarchy had given place
to the military usurpation of Cromwell, that those who were
favourable to Congregational sentiments ventured to form
themselves into churches in provincial places,&mdash;always
doubly exposed to the inspection of ill-designing curiosity. <a
name="citation108b"></a><a href="#footnote108b"
class="citation">[108b]</a></p>
<p><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>Though it is doubtful whether Cromwell really embraced
the sentiments of the Independents, yet he certainly countenanced
them, by selecting his chaplains, and supplying vacancies in the
universities, from amongst the members of their communion; and by
recognising in his public acts the right of private judgment. <a
name="citation109"></a><a href="#footnote109"
class="citation">[109]</a>&nbsp; The instrument of government
which he framed, declared that none should be compelled to
conform to the public religion, by penalties or otherwise; and
that such as professed faith in God by Jesus Christ, though
differing in judgment from the doctrine, worship, or discipline,
publicly held forth, should not be restrained from, but should <a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>be
protected in, the profession of their faith and exercise of their
religion, so as they abused not that liberty to the civil injury
of others, and to the actual disturbance of the public peace. <a
name="citation110"></a><a href="#footnote110"
class="citation">[110]</a></p>
<p>An exception was made to the prejudice of &ldquo;popery&rdquo;
and &ldquo;prelacy,&rdquo; which would be generally regarded, by
the Independents of the present day, as equally unjustifiable and
needless.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> formation of an Independent
church at Beccles naturally followed from the course of events
sketched in the preceding chapters.&nbsp; The sufferings of the
martyrs, the puritans, and the Brownists, had preserved the
leaven of christian freedom; and the political circumstances of
the times combined with the fostering aid of the Norwich and
Yarmouth churches, to encourage its manifestation, and to promote
its diffusion.&nbsp; Upon those models several christian
societies <a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>were formed, in various towns of Norfolk and Suffolk,
during the years 1652 and 1653. <a name="citation112a"></a><a
href="#footnote112a" class="citation">[112a]</a>&nbsp; Beccles
took the lead.&nbsp; The church book opens with the following
record:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;The 6th day of
ye fifth month, com&rsquo;only called July, 1652.&rdquo; <a
name="citation112b"></a><a href="#footnote112b"

</blockquote>
<p>Although this mutual engagement was all that was essential to
the formation of a church of Christ, yet on an occasion so deeply
interesting, and fraught with consequences so momentous, it was
natural that the brethren elsewhere should be requested to add
their approval, their counsel, and their prayers.&nbsp; In the
Congregational church book at Norwich, a letter is stated to have
been &ldquo;received from the Christians at Beckles, by which
they signified their intention to gather into church
fellowship,&rdquo; and desired that church would &ldquo;send
messengers to be there upon the 23. of July, 1652.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Daniel Bradford, James Gooding, and Samuel Clarke, were selected
for this service.</p>
<p>The first of these three individuals had been &ldquo;employed
in the army,&rdquo; when the Yarmouth <a name="page114"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>church was formed, and was
afterwards a deacon at Norwich.&nbsp; The other two appear to
have been among Mr. Bridge&rsquo;s companions in exile, and to
have returned with him. <a name="citation114a"></a><a
href="#footnote114a" class="citation">[114a]</a>&nbsp; Doubtless
they were men whose zeal was chastened by experience and
discretion, and whose piety had stood the tests of time and
persecution.</p>
<p>It was usual with the early Independents, at the formation of
their churches, to sign an agreement, or covenant, expressive of
their objects in thus associating, and pledging themselves to the
faithful performance of the duties devolving upon them as church
members. <a name="citation114b"></a><a href="#footnote114b"
class="citation">[114b]</a>&nbsp; On the formation of their first
church at Norwich, their <i>covenant</i> was read aloud by one,
and then subscribed by all the brethren.</p>
<p>That document, since it is highly probable that, at least in
substance, it was adopted on the gathering of the church at
Beccles, shall now be laid before the reader.&nbsp; It displays a
noble solemnity and simplicity, connected with a candour and
sense of fallibility, which have been justly <a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>described
as &ldquo;extremely graceful and evangelical.&rdquo; <a
name="citation115"></a><a href="#footnote115"
class="citation">[115]</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is manifest by God&rsquo;s word, that
God alwaies was pleased to walke in a way of couenant with his
people knitt together in a visible church estate, He promising to
be their God, and they promising to be his people, separated from
the world and the pollutions thereof as may appeare therein.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wee therefore, whose names are subscribed, being
desirous (in the feare of God) to worship and serve Him according
to his reuealed will, and beleeving it to be our duty to walke in
a way of church couenant, doe freely and solemnly couenant with
the Lord and one another, in the presence of his saints and
angells&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;1.&nbsp; That we will forever acknowledge and avouch

<p>&ldquo;5.&nbsp; Lastly, we doe not couenant or promise these

word</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation116"></a><a href="#footnote116"
class="citation">[116]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such was the spirit, if not the letter, of the <a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>mutual
engagement into which they entered, who introduced into the town
of Beccles the Independent form of church government.</p>
<p>Within twelve months from the formation of the church,
twenty-one other persons had joined.&nbsp; The first of these was
Mr. Joseph Cutlove, who appears to have been, at the same time,
portreeve of the Corporation of Beccles, and to have had some
influential friends among the members of the long parliament. <a
name="citation117"></a><a href="#footnote117"
class="citation">[117]</a>&nbsp; Amongst the names <a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>is also
that of &ldquo;Humphry Brewster,&rdquo; one of the truly
honourable family to whom belonged the hall and manors of
Wrentham, and who, for many years, greatly encouraged and
supported the dissenting interest there. <a
name="citation118a"></a><a href="#footnote118a"
class="citation">[118a]</a>&nbsp; And &ldquo;Francis
Hayloucke,&rdquo; subsequently a deacon of the church.</p>
<p>During the above period there was no recognised pastor.&nbsp;
But in the year 1653, occurs this memorandum:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;29 d. 5 m.
com&rsquo;only called July.</p>
<p>A pastor was chosen.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who this was is rather uncertain; perhaps <span
class="smcap">Mr. John Clark</span>.</p>
<p>He seems to have been a minister in the established church,
for in the parochial register, under the years 1647 and 1648, are
recorded the baptisms of two sons of &ldquo;John Clark, minister,
and of Ann his wife.&rdquo; <a name="citation118b"></a><a
href="#footnote118b" class="citation">[118b]</a>&nbsp; It is also
observable <a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>that his name is the first enrolled on the list of
members of the Independent church.&nbsp; And among the
individuals subsequently admitted, was &ldquo;Anna&rdquo; his
wife; which serves to identify him with the person mentioned in
the parish register.</p>
<p>He does not appear to have engaged fully in the performance of
pastoral duties.&nbsp; Perhaps he had a lingering preference for
the establishment, although the peculiar circumstances of the
times, after the death of Charles the first, induced him to unite
with other serious persons in church fellowship.&nbsp; Dr. Walker
states that he got possession of the living of Beccles in 1655.
<a name="citation119"></a><a href="#footnote119"
class="citation">[119]</a>&nbsp; This he might be enabled to
accomplish when Cromwell, in order that the Presbyterians might
not fill all the livings with persons of their persuasion,
appointed, by an ordinance in council, <a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>commissioners, partly selected from the Independent
denomination, to examine all persons seeking admission to
benefices. <a name="citation120"></a><a href="#footnote120"
class="citation">[120]</a></p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It was to be expected that the possession of religious
liberty, in a degree before unequalled, would occasion the
propagation of many opinions previously unknown or concealed
through fear.&nbsp; The Baptists, especially, now became a
distinct and important denomination.&nbsp; They were the objects
of bitter scorn and invective from the Presbyterian party, who
had gained the ascendancy, and were treated with less kindness by
the Independents than might reasonably have been expected.&nbsp;
In 1656, two persons who had been members of the Independent
church at Beccles, received adult baptism, and in so doing were
considered to have given &ldquo;offence&rdquo; to the church, and
desired to appear and &ldquo;give an account of their
practices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are some subsequent instances of a similar kind.&nbsp;
It was natural that, entertaining peculiar opinions as to the
mode and objects of <a name="page121"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>christian baptism, they should unite
with societies professing the same sentiments.&nbsp; Greatly is
it to be lamented that uncharitableness should ever have intruded
where intolerance would have been deprecated; that
fellow-christians should have allowed these minor differences of
sentiment to create even an apparent separation of heart, or</p>
<blockquote><p>&mdash;&ldquo;Let the basin and the flood<br />
Divide the purchase of that blood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where <i>all</i> must plunge or die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next pastor, and the transactions connected with his
ministry will require a more extended notice.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robert Ottee</span> was a native of Great
Yarmouth, where his father carried on the business of a
boddice-maker. <a name="citation121"></a><a href="#footnote121"
class="citation">[121]</a>&nbsp; The son appears to have received
such an education as, in some measure, fitted him for the more
elevated and responsible situation he was destined to
occupy.&nbsp; He was kept at the Latin school till he was old
enough to be employed in his father&rsquo;s trade, at which he
worked several years.&nbsp; It does not appear that <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>at this
early period of his life, he had any view to the ministry; but
his inclination towards mental pursuits was so decided, that
nothing but a deep sense of filial duty would have reconciled him
to the manual occupation in which he found himself engaged.&nbsp;
He had already imbibed a conviction of the supreme importance of
religion, and while he laboured with his hands, his Bible
generally lay open before him.</p>
<p>Prompted by his serious impressions he attended the meetings
of some Christians in his native town, held for united, earnest
prayer, and other religious exercises.&nbsp; On one occasion an
individual whose assistance was mainly depended upon, was
prevented from being present.&nbsp; Mr. Ottee was induced to pray
and expound a passage of Scripture; and he acquitted himself so
well, as to call forth the admiration of the most intelligent
persons present.&nbsp; Some of them applied to Mr. Bridge,
desiring that he would encourage so promising a young man to
devote himself to the christian ministry.</p>
<p>But Mr. Ottee evinced the same prudence which distinguished
him through life, and a diffidence <a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>as to his qualifications, which is
the frequent attendant on intellectual or religious attainments
of a superior order.&nbsp; There were some who had previously
received encouragement from Mr. Bridge, but who, not having been
favoured with similar advantages of education, had not altogether
fulfilled the sanguine expectations of their friends.&nbsp; He
determined, therefore, not to yield to Mr. Bridge&rsquo;s
suggestions, till he had consulted Mr. Brinsley, the exemplary
and persecuted parish minister of Yarmouth. <a
name="citation123a"></a><a href="#footnote123a"
class="citation">[123a]</a>&nbsp; That grave, but urbane man, had
repeated conversations with him on the subject, and was so fully
satisfied as to his knowledge of the Scriptures, his gifts, his
seriousness of spirit, and holiness of conversation, as to join
cordially in recommending him to apply himself to the great
duties of a minister of the gospel. <a name="citation123b"></a><a
href="#footnote123b" class="citation">[123b]</a></p>
<p>His sense of the immense responsibility connected with the
ministry would not allow him to think of blending with it the
pursuits of trade.&nbsp; He had imbibed a settled conviction
that, to use his own expression, <i>the work of the gospel was
</i><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span><i>sufficient for one man</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is
nothing,&rdquo; says he, in one of his sermons, &ldquo;more plain
in Scripture than this, that those whom God hath set [apart] to
the work of the ministry are exempted from other worldly trades
and callings.&nbsp; It hath been an abuse, in this nation, to
think that men may trade, and buy, and sell, and run into all
worldly business, and yet undertake the preaching of the gospel:
yea, some there are, called the regular clergy, yet give
themselves too much to farming, buying, and selling, and secular
employments; this doth come short of their calling; for mind what
the apostle saith to Timothy, in 1 Tim. iv. 13, &lsquo;Till I
come, give thyself to reading, to exhortation, to
doctrine.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a name="citation124a"></a><a
href="#footnote124a" class="citation">[124a]</a></p>
<p>Mr. Ottee appears to have been residing in Beccles when the
Independent church was formed.&nbsp; In the year 1656, he
accepted the pastoral charge of the people with whom he had long
&ldquo;held sweet counsel.&rdquo; <a name="citation124b"></a><a
href="#footnote124b" class="citation">[124b]</a>&nbsp; The
circumstance is thus briefly recorded in the church book.</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>&ldquo;12th No. 56.</p>
<p>Mr. Otty made paster by y<sup>e</sup> church.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This has been supposed to refer to his ordination, and the
memorandum occurring 29th July, 1653, to his election.&nbsp; But
a delay of more than three years between the choice and
settlement of a pastor scarcely admits of a satisfactory
explanation.&nbsp; The expression, &ldquo;<i>made pastor</i> by
the church,&rdquo; moreover, raises a strong presumption that the
occurrence included, if it did not refer solely to, the
<i>election</i> of a pastor.&nbsp; That expression would scarcely
have been used with reference to the mere ordination of an
individual, previously elected to the pastoral office. <a
name="citation125"></a><a href="#footnote125"
class="citation">[125]</a></p>
<p><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>With
Mr. Ottee&rsquo;s pastorate commenced the appointment of such
other officers as are sanctioned by the holy Scriptures, and the
regular administration of christian ordinances to his
flock.&nbsp; With reference to these subjects, the church book
contains some memoranda, which will be perused with interest by
those connected with the church or congregation.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;December 29th,

name="citation127b"></a><a href="#footnote127b"
class="citation">[127b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The deacons were evidently, according to the examples recorded
in the New Testament, &ldquo;men of honest report, full of the
Holy Ghost and wisdom,&rdquo; chosen by the brethren, and set
apart <a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>to
serve the table of the Lord, and that of the poor members; to
take charge, in a word, of the secular affairs of the church,
while the pastor gave himself &ldquo;continually to prayer, and
to the ministry of the word.&rdquo; <a name="citation128a"></a><a
href="#footnote128a" class="citation">[128a]</a>&nbsp; They found
no description of the deacon&rsquo;s office, as a gradation in
the christian ministry, or as preliminary to it; or as continuing
&ldquo;for the space of a whole year;&rdquo; or as including the
administration of baptism and the duty of preaching, subject to
the approbation of a bishop.&nbsp; They discarded these human
inventions, and found their highest satisfaction in an adherence
to the precedents of the New Testament.</p>
<p>The mode of administering the Lord&rsquo;s supper was that
which had been, long before, adopted by the Brownists <a
name="citation128b"></a><a href="#footnote128b"
class="citation">[128b]</a>&mdash;that which the apostolic
account, <a name="citation128c"></a><a href="#footnote128c"
class="citation">[128c]</a> and the nature and design of the
institution, <a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>alike indicated as the most appropriate.&nbsp; They who
had openly professed their love and allegiance to Jesus Christ,
commemorated his death in obedience to his command, enjoyed
communion with Him and with one another in the sacred feast and,
with grateful joy, found themselves delivered from the imposition
of a posture, which had been the natural accompaniment and
indication of a belief in transubstantiation, which was unsuited
to the ordinance, and had no warrant in the word of God.</p>
<p>Baptism was administered to the children of believers, as a
sign of the gracious covenant God had made with the parents, and
as an occasion for parental dedication and the solemn promise of
christian instruction.&nbsp; But the use of sponsors was
discarded, as alike unscriptural and unnatural; the sign of the
cross was omitted, as a departure from the simplicity of the
gospel, implying a proportionate approach to superstition; and
the doctrine of baptismal regeneration was rejected, as
calculated to produce and nourish a fatal delusion.</p>
<p>It is essential to the efficient existence of <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>every
society, whether secular or religious, that some regulations
should be adopted with regard to the admission of its
members.&nbsp; But the distinction cannot be too carefully
noticed, between arrangements of this nature assented to by
persons voluntarily associated for religious purposes, and terms
of church fellowship enforced by authority, under civil
penalties, directly or indirectly attaching to
nonconformity.&nbsp; The former are consistent with unlimited
toleration; the latter involve the very essence of
intolerance.</p>
<p>Mr. Ottee appears to have exercised a very commendable
prudence in the admission of members into his church.&nbsp; Some
of the brethren were usually appointed to confer with the
candidates, &ldquo;in order to the church&rsquo;s
satisfaction.&rdquo;&nbsp; And repeated instances are recorded in
which the society suspended its decision, until they could
&ldquo;give further satisfaction,&rdquo; and should again apply
for admission.</p>
<p>At a church meeting, held 25th February, 1656, the following
resolution was recorded, apparently referring to Mr.
Ottee&rsquo;s recent settlement.</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>&ldquo;It was likewise agreed upon, that this day
fortnett, being the eleventh day of March, begininge at eleven of
the clocke, be spent by the church in thanksgivinge unto God, for
his gracious returneinge unto us in a way of mercye, for
o<sup>r</sup> settlement after those many shakeinges we have bene
under, in refference to o<sup>r</sup> present church state, &amp;
y<sup>t</sup> the Lord hath bene pleased both to give us to have
the priviledges of his people administred unto us, &amp; to oure
children; &amp; alsoe that we then seeke unto him by ernest
supplication, for further grace, wisdome, &amp; assistance, to
walke in his house, as those who are priviledged w<sup>th</sup>
such mercye&mdash;this meetinge to be at o<sup>r</sup> brother
Edmond Artis his house.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hearts thus attuned to praise, sought its expression in
&ldquo;psalms and hymns, and spiritual songs.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Singing would have exposed the puritans to considerable peril,
while they were obliged to meet in secret that they might evade
the fang of persecution.&nbsp; But now &ldquo;had the churches
rest;&rdquo; and they joyfully availed themselves of a privilege,
at once permitted and prompted by their improved
circumstances.&nbsp; At the next <a name="page132"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 132</span>meeting the subject was brought
under consideration.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Att the monthly meeting of the church, upon
the 25th day of the first month, called March, [1657].</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was agreed by the church, that they doe put in
practice the ordinance of singinge, in the publiq upon the
forenoone and afternoone on the Lord&rsquo;s daies, and that it
be betweene praier and sermon; and also it was agreed that the
New England translation of the Psallmes be made use of by the
church, at their times of breaking of bread: and it was agreed
that the next Lord&rsquo;s day seventh-night be the day to enter
upon the work of singinge in publiq.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The metrical version of the Psalms, alluded to in the above
extract, was published in 1640.&nbsp; The pilgrim fathers,
&ldquo;though they blessed God for the religious endeavours of
those who translated the Psalms into the metre usually annexed at
the end of the Bible,&rdquo; yet observed in that translation so
many variations, not only from the text, but from the very sense
of the Psalmist, that &ldquo;it was an offence unto
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>Each of their chief divines took a portion to
translate, and the whole was afterwards revised by Mr. Henry
Dunster, President of Harvard College.&nbsp; They claimed the
merit of a close adherence to the Hebrew, but were conscious that
their versification was, by no means, free from
imperfections.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have respected,&rdquo; said they,
&ldquo;rather a plain translation, than to smooth our verses with
the sweetness of any paraphrase.&nbsp; We have attended
conscience rather than elegance, fidelity rather than ingenuity;
that so we may sing in Zion the Lord&rsquo;s songs of praise,
according unto his own will, until he bid us enter into our
Master&rsquo;s joy, to sing eternal hallelujahs.&rdquo; <a
name="citation133"></a><a href="#footnote133"
class="citation">[133]</a></p>
<p>Whatever might be the comparative claims of a version of the
Psalms composed two hundred years ago, it would grate upon ears
accustomed to the more majestic flow of modern poetry.&nbsp; It
has been the privilege&mdash;the almost exclusive privilege of
nonconformity, to have derived the benefit of progressing
refinement, and to have retained poetry as the permanent handmaid
of devotion, while in the national churches the uncouth <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>doggerel of
the sixteenth century is still cherished as a thing which it were
sacrilege to touch.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The Independents never introduced into their assemblies that
unbounded liberty of teaching, which had been the mark and the
bane of the Brownist churches. <a name="citation134"></a><a
href="#footnote134" class="citation">[134]</a>&nbsp; But they
desired, under the prudent, constant, and salutary
superintendence of a ministry invested, if not with more
extensive powers, with a more commanding moral influence, to
retain the advantages of an open discussion of topics connected
with their religious system and spiritual prosperity.&nbsp; The
following extracts from the church book, show that something of
this kind was attempted at Beccles.&nbsp; The reader will regret,
that no account of the questions discussed, or of the manner in
which they were treated, has been preserved.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It was likewise&rdquo; (at the meeting,
held 25th March, 1657) further &ldquo;agreed, that upon the next
monthly meeting, the church doe <a name="page135"></a><span

<p>&ldquo;At a meetinge of the church upon the 3rd day of the

condesended unto, that two of these bretheren hereunder written

</blockquote>
<p>Sept. 20th, 1658, occurs the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;At a meetinge then of the church, beinge

</blockquote>
<p>Previously to the death of Oliver Cromwell the Independents
had petitioned for liberty to hold this synod.&nbsp; They had
acquired, especially in Suffolk and Norfolk, considerable
importance by their numbers, and by the accession of many opulent
persons.&nbsp; But they had been (to use their own expressions)
like so many ships launched singly, and sailing apart and alone
in the vast ocean of those tumultuous times, exposed to every
wind of doctrine, under no other conduct than the word and
Spirit, and their particular elders and principal brethren,
without associations among themselves, or so much as holding out
a common light to others whereby to know where they were. <a
name="citation137"></a><a href="#footnote137"
class="citation">[137]</a>&nbsp; It is a circumstance which
strikingly distinguishes the Independents from the Brownists,
that while <a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>they strenuously contended against the exercise of any
spiritual authority, even by the gravest and wisest assemblies of
men, they desired &ldquo;that there might be a correspondence
between their churches, in city and country, for counsel and
mutual edification,&rdquo; and that the world might know to what
extent they, &ldquo;being many,&rdquo; were &ldquo;one
body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The meeting at the Savoy consisted of ministers and messengers
from above a hundred Congregational churches, and was graced by
the presence of Howe, then chaplain to the young Protector, and
of other eminent divines.&nbsp; The synod was opened by a day of
fasting and prayer; and a committee of six divines, including Mr.
Bridge of Yarmouth, was appointed to draw up a confession.&nbsp;
On the 12th of October, the assembly agreed upon &ldquo;a
declaration of the faith and order owned and practised in the
Congregational churches in England.&rdquo;&nbsp; As its basis
they adopted the confession drawn up in 1643, by the Westminster
assembly of divines, omitting, however, all that related to the
<i>power</i> of synods and councils, and of the civil magistrate
in religious <a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>matters.&nbsp; They added a chapter on the proper
magnitude of sacred societies, as properly congregational, though
not so isolated as to preclude mutual counsel; the proper
subjects of church-membership, namely, those who in the judgment
of charity are sanctified persons; the commencement of the church
relationship by the free choice of the individuals, and not by
accidental dwelling in a particular civil district; the
requisiteness, however, of the associating of believers who
reside in the same city, town, or neighbourhood; the right of the
members at large to be consulted, and the necessity of the
concurrence of a majority of them, in all important transactions
of the society; and the propriety of receiving into their
communion those of different sentiments, so far as consistent
with their own principles. <a name="citation139a"></a><a
href="#footnote139a" class="citation">[139a]</a>&nbsp; They
concluded with an expression of gratitude to their governors for
the liberty of conscience they enjoyed, and that this liberty was
established by law, so long as they disturbed not the public
peace. <a name="citation139b"></a><a href="#footnote139b"
class="citation">[139b]</a></p>
<p><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>On
the 2nd of March, 1658, a meeting of the church was held at
Flixton, (seven miles from Beccles,) for the purpose of
administering the ordinance of baptism to several children.</p>
<p>Another church meeting was held 3rd March, 1659.&nbsp; The
detailed account of the proceedings of the society then abruptly
terminates.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The death of Cromwell, and the resignation of his upright but
unaspiring son, involved the national affairs in new
difficulty.&nbsp; The hour of comparative sunshine which religion
had enjoyed had well nigh passed away.&nbsp; The restoration of
the monarchy was indeed spoken of as an event calculated to unite
all the jarring elements of the state;&mdash;a glowing hope,
resembling the intense fervour of sunshine which precedes and
foretells the renewal of the storm.</p>
<p>In 1662, was passed the Act of Uniformity, than which no
chapter of the Statute Book has obtained, in the estimation of
just and liberal men, a more ignominious notoriety.&nbsp; It
demanded a perfect conformity to the Book of Common Prayer, and
the rites and ceremonies of the established <a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>church.&nbsp; The 5th September (O. S.) 1662, on which
day it came into operation, was properly denominated the
<i>black</i> Bartholomew-day.&nbsp; &ldquo;That
Bartholomew-day&rdquo; (says Locke) &ldquo;was fatal to our
church and religion, by throwing out a very great number of
worthy, learned, pious, and orthodox divines.&rdquo;&nbsp; By
this statute nearly two thousand five hundred ministers were
silenced.&nbsp; And it is affirmed that, upon a moderate
calculation, it procured the untimely death of three thousand
nonconformists, and the ruin of sixty thousand families. <a
name="citation141"></a><a href="#footnote141"
class="citation">[141]</a></p>
<p>This proceeding, however, was witnessed by the dissenting body
more in sorrow than in anger.&nbsp; One of the leading
Independents in Suffolk thus expressed himself.&nbsp;
&ldquo;About this time was the breaking up of the ministry; which
sad dispensation I was very sensible of, and much bewailed <a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>in my own
spirit, and in secret mourning for the sin and misery of England
that had undone itself and declared itself unworthy of the
gospel: writing <i>Ichabod</i> upon all my enjoyments, whilst the
glory was departed; calling to mind my own iniquity that helped
on this sad judgment.&rdquo; <a name="citation142"></a><a
href="#footnote142" class="citation">[142]</a></p>
<p>The Act of Uniformity had, according to Dr. Calamy, the
immediate effect of silencing both <a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>Mr. John Clark and Mr. Ottee.&nbsp;
Of the former, no further account has been handed down.&nbsp; The
latter appears to have been soon enabled, by his own prudence,
and through the respect which a holy and benevolent character
often receives even from the worldly and narrow-minded, to
continue the more private exercise of his ministry.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the passing of the Conventicle Act and the
Five Mile Act, designed more effectually to crush the dissenting
congregations and separate their pastors from them, he appears to
have gone on, through the remaining years of the Stuart dynasty,
preaching the gospel to his people in Beccles.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
God continued&rdquo; (says Dr. Calamy) &ldquo;to bless his
labours among them to the end of his days.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
presided over his church with remarkable prudence and
fidelity.&nbsp; His preaching was as solid and useful as it was
plain, and &ldquo;met with approbation, both from ministers and
private Christians of all denominations.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
following testimony by Mr. Bidbanck of Denton, is equally
strong.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was, as is well known, an interpreter one
of a thousand, Job xxxiii. 23; an Apollos, mighty in the <a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>Scriptures,
Acts xviii. 24.&rdquo; <a name="citation144a"></a><a
href="#footnote144a" class="citation">[144a]</a>&nbsp; If he
preached five or six sermons without hearing of any good effect,
he was greatly dejected and very fervent in prayer for more
abundant success.</p>
<p>Towards the close of his life, he had, as he told Mr.
Bidbanck, &ldquo;many warnings of putting off his
tabernacle.&rdquo;&nbsp; With a view to his own consolation under
those circumstances, and to the edification of his flock, he
preached, in the mornings of the Lord&rsquo;s days, a course of
sermons upon the seventh chapter of the Epistle to the
Hebrews.&nbsp; These were amongst his last discourses.&nbsp; They
were heard with deep and affectionate interest, and having been
taken down in shorthand from the lips of the preacher, were
published soon after his decease. <a name="citation144b"></a><a
href="#footnote144b" class="citation">[144b]</a></p>
<p><a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>This
little book was introduced to the christian world, by a short
preface from the pen of Mr. Martin Finch, the minister of the
Independent church at Norwich, <a name="citation145"></a><a
href="#footnote145" class="citation">[145]</a> and dedicated to
the deceased pastor&rsquo;s bereaved flock, by Mr.
Bidbanck.&nbsp; In these discourses, Mr. Ottee enlarged upon the
parallel drawn by the apostle between the priesthood of
Melchisedec and that of Jesus Christ, in an expository style,
discovering much energy of thought combined with deep piety and
an ardent desire for usefulness.</p>
<p>Mr. Ottee was, emphatically, a <i>protestant
nonconformist</i>.&nbsp; With him personal piety was, indeed, the
first, the absorbing consideration.&nbsp; But protestantism held
scarcely an inferior place in his esteem.&nbsp; On this subject
his style, even through the mutilating medium of shorthand, <a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>rises to
animation.&nbsp; &ldquo;What prophet, or what apostle,&rdquo; he
exclaims, &ldquo;said any thing for the worshipping of images? or
what apostle, or what prophet, said any thing to warrant the
praying in an unknown tongue?&nbsp; What prophet, or apostle, or
penman of Scripture, hath said any thing concerning the sacrifice
of the mass, for the living and the dead?&nbsp; Oh, filthy
trash!&nbsp; What prophet, or apostle, or penman of the
Scripture, hath said any thing concerning praying souls out of
purgatory, or of having mass read for them?&nbsp; What prophet,
or apostle, or Christ himself, said any thing of purgatory, or
crossing themselves, or their childish crosses and beads?&nbsp;
Of these popish superstitions God hath said nothing in all his
word.&nbsp; And therefore the people of God must never meddle
with these things; and if you be tempted or solicited to any
ceremony, ask the question, Have Moses, or the prophets, or
Christ, or his apostles, said any thing to this matter that you
are so zealous for?&nbsp; O, search the Scripture; and what you
find there, you are to practise in faith and in the fear of
God.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>To the law and to the testimony</i>, <i>if
they speak not </i><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span><i>according to this word</i>, <i>it is because there
is no light in them</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a
name="citation147a"></a><a href="#footnote147a"
class="citation">[147a]</a></p>
<p>Nor did he hesitate to avow his objections to a church which
retained any traces of the superstitions of popery.&nbsp;
&ldquo;As for us that have the reformed religion, how many
amongst us delight to worship God after the law of a carnal
commandment!&nbsp; Are there not too many amongst us which are
more for old, abrogated ceremonies than they are for a gospel
worship?&nbsp; Bewail and lament the apostasy of this
generation.&rdquo; <a name="citation147b"></a><a
href="#footnote147b" class="citation">[147b]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;If
all the Mosaical rites and ceremonies were weak and imperfect,
and God, for that reason, abolished them, because they could not
reach the main end of man&rsquo;s happiness; then, here you may
see the folly of those men that set up these rites and ceremonies
and human inventions, in part of their worship.&nbsp; If
God&rsquo;s own institutions were weak and unprofitable, what are
men&rsquo;s inventions?&nbsp; Are their priestly vestments
profitable? their crosses and cringings, profitable?&nbsp; What
profit is there in bowing the knee at the word
&lsquo;Jesus&rsquo;? . . .&nbsp; But some will say, these are
ornaments <a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>of the church of God.&nbsp; To that I answer, so is a
painted glass an ornament to the house, yet it shuts out the
light more than a plain glass . . .&nbsp; These painted and
carnal ceremonies do shut out the light of the gospel; for the
light of the gospel shines out more pure and clear in the plain
administration of the gospel; and therefore all those things that
carnal men so magnifie, are unprofitable.&rdquo; <a

class="citation">[148a]</a></p>
<p>Mr. Ottee was <i>congregational</i> in his judgment; but he
held his opinions in combination with so much modesty and
moderation, as to win the esteem and affection of those who
differed from him.&nbsp; In particular, he enjoyed the intimate
friendship of Dr. John Collinges, the learned, pious, and eminent
minister of St. Stephen&rsquo;s church, Norwich. <a
name="citation148b"></a><a href="#footnote148b"
class="citation">[148b]</a></p>
<p>The discourses already quoted, contain ample evidence of the
orthodox character of Mr. Ottee&rsquo;s <a
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>views.&nbsp; They indicate his belief in the doctrine
of original sin; <a name="citation149a"></a><a
href="#footnote149a" class="citation">[149a]</a> of the
consequent moral inability of man to effect his own salvation; <a
name="citation149b"></a><a href="#footnote149b"
class="citation">[149b]</a> of the indispensable importance of
the change called the new birth; <a name="citation149c"></a><a
href="#footnote149c" class="citation">[149c]</a> of the Trinity;
<a name="citation149d"></a><a href="#footnote149d"
class="citation">[149d]</a> of the union of the divine and human
natures in the person of the Son of God; <a
name="citation149e"></a><a href="#footnote149e"
class="citation">[149e]</a> of the atonement made by him for sin;
<a name="citation149f"></a><a href="#footnote149f"
class="citation">[149f]</a> of the obligation resting upon all
men to apply themselves to the exercise of prayer, and to lead a
life of personal holiness; <a name="citation149g"></a><a
href="#footnote149g" class="citation">[149g]</a> and the vanity
of trusting to the mere mercy of God, irrespectively of the
channel through which he has revealed his willingness to bestow
it. <a name="citation149h"></a><a href="#footnote149h"
class="citation">[149h]</a></p>
<p>There is another topic to which this excellent man adverted in
his published sermons, which must not be passed unnoticed.&nbsp;
This was, the duty of believers to provide for the support of a
succession of christian ministers.&nbsp; In connexion with the
statement of the sacred writer, that Abraham gave Melchisedec a
tenth part of the spoil of the four kings, he
remarks,&mdash;&ldquo;I know it <a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>hath been long a dispute whether
tenths or tithes ought to be continued any longer, or any more
than altars and sacrifices, in a reformed christian church: I
shall not determine that; but this we may all be assured of, that
if tithes or tenths be of the ceremonial law, and so are
abolished, yet the moral equity is to abide to the end of the
world,&mdash;that those that minister at God&rsquo;s altar,
should have honourable and comfortable maintenance.&rdquo; <a
name="citation150"></a><a href="#footnote150"
class="citation">[150]</a></p>
<p>And referring to the mortality of the priesthood, he says,
&ldquo;We ought to pray that there may never want a succession of
men to carry on the work of God.&nbsp; And this ought to be our
care also, as far as in us lies, that there may be a generation
brought up for the service of God, when another goes away.&nbsp;
When Abraham died, his son Isaac succeeded him.&nbsp; When Aaron
died, Eleazar succeeded, and took up the work of God that his
father had laid down.&nbsp; So it would be the happiness of
families, that children would take up the work that their fathers
have laid down by reason of death.&nbsp; We live in an age
wherein there <a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>is a great decay of godly ministers: the old generation
wearing off, and many gone to the dust, and but few come in, that
have the same spirit, the same grace, and shine with the same
light as their fathers did, who are dead and gone.&nbsp; We
ought, all of us, to pray, as our Saviour saith, that, as the
harvest is great, the Lord would send forth labourers into his
harvest.&nbsp; A good succession speaks a great favour of God, to
families, churches, and nations.&nbsp; See how careful Moses was
in that.&nbsp; When God had told him that he must die, (in Numb,
xxvii. 16,) &lsquo;Let the Lord, the God of the spirits of all
flesh, set a man over the congregation.&rsquo;&nbsp; And truly,
so should all godly parents and godly ministers say, Let the God
of the spirits of all flesh bring in some to my family that may
go out and in before my family; and let the God of the spirits of
all flesh bring in some to his church, to guide them and to teach
them.&rdquo; <a name="citation151"></a><a href="#footnote151"
class="citation">[151]</a></p>
<p>Mr. Ottee closed his useful career about the <a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>end of
April, 1689, <a name="citation152a"></a><a href="#footnote152a"
class="citation">[152a]</a> a few days before the Toleration Act
laid a basis for the gradual attainment of religious liberty. <a

class="citation">[152b]</a></p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In May, 1687, a part of the site of the present meeting-house
had been purchased by the deacons, <a name="page153"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 153</span>Edmund Artis and Francis Haylouck,
probably with a view to the erection of a building for public
worship.</p>
<p>It will be observed that this was immediately after the first
declaration for liberty of conscience was issued by James II. <a
name="citation153"></a><a href="#footnote153"
class="citation">[153]</a>&nbsp; The hollowness of the
king&rsquo;s professions was probably discovered before any
further measures had been taken: for there appears to have been
some delay in the completion of the building.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The deacons just mentioned survived their excellent
pastor.&nbsp; Two of the silver cups still used by the church in
the celebration of the Lord&rsquo;s supper, had been marked, at
an earlier date, with a faint, perhaps with a trembling
hand,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="GutSmall">FOR Y</span><span
class="GutSmall"><sup>E</sup></span><span class="GutSmall">
CH</span>: A. H.&nbsp; E. F R.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This somewhat enigmatical inscription was afterwards
interpreted by adding in deeply cut letters, upon one of the
cups,</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p>and upon the other,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> wisdom of Providence is often
exemplified in the disappointment of hopes, in themselves worthy
to be indulged.&nbsp; He who turns the devices of his enemies to
the accomplishment of his will, thus teaches his servants the
insufficiency of all that they can do, independently of his aid
and guidance, for the promotion of his glory.&nbsp; God does not
forsake the work of his own hands; but he retains to himself the
high prerogative, to choose the period and the instruments of its
accomplishment.&nbsp; This consideration should reconcile the
Christian to alternations of <a name="page156"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 156</span>prosperity and adversity in the
history of the churches, and should cheer the heart, and
invigorate the hand, under circumstances the most
discouraging.</p>
<p>For a long series of years after Mr. Ottee&rsquo;s death the
church and congregation at Beccles were, from a variety of
causes, in a declining state.&nbsp; It will be well, if the
contemplation of this period lead to a grateful feeling of mind
under present prosperity, and induce, for the future,
watchfulness against all departures from the faith and practice
of the gospel, by which alone a church of Christ can be really
injured.</p>
<p>On the 26th of October, 1691, <span class="smcap">Mr. Joseph
Tate</span>, having previously been received into the church, was
solemnly set apart to the office of its pastor.</p>
<p>In the year 1693, the congregation sustained the loss of a
promising, and apparently robust, young man, named <i>Augustine
Gregory</i>, who had been designed for the ministry, but was
carried off by consumption in his seventeenth year.&nbsp; An
interesting letter has been preserved, <a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>which was
addressed to him a short time before his death, by his intimate
friend, Mr. Josiah Baker, one of the excellent family at
Wattisfield, to whom a reference has been already made. <a
name="citation157"></a><a href="#footnote157"
class="citation">[157]</a></p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align:
right">&ldquo;<i>Wattisfield</i>, <i>Sept.</i> 7<i>th</i>,
1693.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dying friend,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your present condition directs me to this epithet,
which, though in itself it might seem harsh and grating, yet I
hope your daily conversing with death will take off whatever of
that nature may be in it absolutely considered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The great probability that there appears to be that we
shall never meet again in this world, is an argument with me to
trouble you with a few lines as a testimony of my truest
affection, and to bid you farewell till we meet in a better
world.</p>
<p>. . . . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;It behoves you to see that the foundation of a good
work be laid in deep humiliation for sin, both original and
actual, that there be not only a partial, but a thorough change
wrought in you; <a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>that there be an unreserved resignation of yourself to
a whole Christ, and a fixed reliance upon him alone for
salvation; and all this joined with a filial submission to a
Father&rsquo;s rod, in your present condition.</p>
<p>. . . . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sweet in-comes which I hope you find under this
rod, may greatly reconcile you to your present condition; and the
forethoughts of the glory to come, and uninterrupted communion
above, may beget in you a longing after the future state.&nbsp;
God in his infinite wisdom, does generally give more fellowship
and communion with himself, under affliction, than at other
times, both for the comfort and peace of the afflicted, and to
show that He is all, <i>without</i> all, as well as <i>in</i> all
ordinances.&nbsp; And this should reconcile us to the sharpest
affliction, even to death itself; if we may have His presence,
his rod and his staff, to comfort us.&nbsp; The Lord&rsquo;s end,
in affliction, is to take away sin; and if it be his will that we
should not come back into a sinful world, but be removed into a
sinless state above, we have no reason to be unwilling to put off
our rags of <a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>mortality, that we may put on robes of immortality, and
to go to that place, where all tears of conviction, humiliation,
and affliction, shall be wiped off, and all sin and sorrow shall
flee away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are made a singular example to all spectators about
you, and especially to all young persons.&nbsp; It is eminently
verified in you, that all flesh is grass, and as the flower in
the field, so it fades and withers.&nbsp; And when I see so green
grass withered, and so fair a flower faded, it teacheth me that
the young man is not to glory in his strength.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
sure there is a peculiar voice to myself in this
affliction.&nbsp; The Lord grant I may hear that instruction
which he intends by it, and that it may be sealed by his Spirit
upon my heart!</p>
<p>. . . . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farewell, my dear friend.&nbsp; The Lord bless you, and
make his face to shine upon you, and lift up the light of his
countenance upon your soul.&nbsp; The Lord give you that
assurance of his favour which you wait for, that joy and peace in
believing, that may give you an abundant entrance <a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>into the
everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, where,
I hope, at the glorious resurrection, you shall meet with</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Your most affectionate<br />
and sympathizing friend,<br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Josiah Baker</span>.&rdquo; <a

class="citation">[160]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>During Mr. Tate&rsquo;s ministry at Beccles, upwards of thirty
persons joined the church.&nbsp; But on the 28th November, 1694,
he resigned his pastoral office, by a memorandum under his hand,
in the church book; and his dismissal was testified by the
signatures of &ldquo;Edmund Artis,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fran.
Haylouck,&rdquo; the deacons.</p>
<p>In the same year Mr. Tate became pastor of the Independent
church then assembling at Girdler&rsquo;s Hall, London, where he
succeeded Mr. George Griffith, an eminent preacher during the
interregnum, and a principal manager in the synod held by the
Independents in 1658.&nbsp; The afternoon service at
Girdler&rsquo;s Hall was conducted by Mr. Tate for twelve or
thirteen years, but of his subsequent history there are no
traces.&nbsp; That <a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>church afterwards became scattered among other
societies.&nbsp; Many of them joined in communion under the
celebrated Dr. Isaac Watts. <a name="citation161a"></a><a
href="#footnote161a" class="citation">[161a]</a></p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The church at Beccles remained without a settled pastor for
nearly three years after Mr. Tate&rsquo;s resignation.</p>
<p>In the interval, John Primrose and Nathaniel Newton were
ordained deacons. <a name="citation161b"></a><a
href="#footnote161b" class="citation">[161b]</a>&nbsp; It is most
likely that the first meeting-house in Beccles was erected at
this period; for on the 11th January, 1696, (O. S.) the ground
which had been purchased some years earlier, together with
&ldquo;<i>a house thereupon newly built</i>,&rdquo; was conveyed
to trustees, <a name="citation161c"></a><a href="#footnote161c"
class="citation">[161c]</a> and the intention of the parties was
declared, by a schedule annexed to the deed, that the house
should be employed as a place of public worship for such
protestants inhabiting in Beccles and the neighbouring <a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>towns, as
could not conform to the established religion. <a
name="citation162"></a><a href="#footnote162"
class="citation">[162]</a></p>
<p><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>On
the 28th July, 1697, <span class="smcap">Mr. John
Killinghall</span> was admitted a member, and on the 13th of the
following October, he was set apart to the office of pastor.</p>
<p>He was an excellent preacher, and for some time highly
esteemed here.&nbsp; But in September 1699, the pleasing prospect
became clouded by an incorrectness of conduct calling for the
severest discipline of the church. <a name="citation163"></a><a
href="#footnote163" class="citation">[163]</a>&nbsp; There was no
attempt to palliate sin, though it had gained a temporary victory
over one, whose degradation could not fail to bring discredit
upon the christian profession.&nbsp; The church proceeded with
awful firmness, though not without full proof and a due weighing
of all circumstances, to show their obedience to Christ&rsquo;s
institutions, by excluding the offender from their
communion.&nbsp; It has been said that some persons of the
establishment considered him to have been too severely <a
name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>treated: it
does not appear that he ever thought so himself.&nbsp; Deeply
penitent, not only that he had &ldquo;wronged his own
soul,&rdquo; but also that he had caused the good of others to be
evil spoken of, he applied for some time to secular business,
demeaning himself with great modesty and becoming remorse.&nbsp;
These circumstances, combined with a desire on the part of the
church to evince the utmost allowable tenderness towards an
erring brother, led to his re-admission after the lapse of some
months.</p>
<p>These circumstances have long since been made public.&nbsp;
Historical justice forbids their suppression.&nbsp; Nor is there
any sufficient reason for adopting such a course.&nbsp; The
individual himself has joined the assembly above, among whom
&ldquo;there is joy over a sinner that repenteth.&rdquo;&nbsp;
None who have any pretensions to justice or candour, will deny
that occurrences like that in question are rare among the ranks
of the dissenting ministry; and none that value the respect of
reasonable and unprejudiced men, will turn the failings of an
individual to the disparagement of a party, much less of its
principles.&nbsp; &ldquo;There <a name="page165"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>are too many faults&rdquo; (to adopt
the language of one distinguished by a truly catholic spirit)
&ldquo;among all parties; but God knows it is fitter for us all
to mend than to recriminate.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yea, but the party we
are of, professes not so much strictness.&rsquo;&nbsp; No?&nbsp;
What party should you be of, that professes less
strictness?&nbsp; What more lax rule of morals have you than
other Christians?&nbsp; Do you not profess subjection to the
known rules of the Bible concerning christian and civil
conversation?&nbsp; You do not, sure, profess rebellion and
hostility against the Lord that bought you?&nbsp; Doth not your
baptismal covenant, which you are supposed to avow, bind you to
as much strictness as any other Christian? . . .&nbsp; We that
think we stand should take heed lest we fall.&nbsp; It is a
costly admonition that is given us in such instances.&rdquo; <a
name="citation165"></a><a href="#footnote165"
class="citation">[165]</a></p>
<p>Mr. Killinghall did not again occupy the pulpit at Beccles;
but about the year 1702 he was chosen pastor of a numerous and
flourishing Independent church at Southwark.&nbsp; The
expectations of those who had been inclined to think favourably
<a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>of him
were not disappointed.&nbsp; He continued with that society
nearly forty years.&nbsp; He was one of the first six ministers
chosen to preach the Horselydown Lecture for the support of a
charity school instituted in 1715.&nbsp; His name is also on the
list of subscribing members at the Salters&rsquo; Hall synod in
1719.&nbsp; He died in the month of January, 1740.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In the interval between Mr. Killinghall&rsquo;s departure and
the settlement of the next pastor, the congregation was probably
supplied by various ministers.&nbsp; In July 1701, the ordinance
of baptism was administered by &ldquo;Mr. Green,&rdquo; most
likely the venerable pastor of the church at Tunstead, in
Norfolk;&mdash;and a visit from so experienced and amiable a
Christian, must have been peculiarly cheering and consolatory. <a
name="citation166"></a><a href="#footnote166"
class="citation">[166]</a></p>
<p><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>Among
other persons admitted to church fellowship on the 2nd of
February, 1703&ndash;4, were &ldquo;Mr. Richard Playters,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Mr. John Crispe.&rdquo;&nbsp; The former surname is
now remembered in the neighbourhood of Beccles, principally in
connexion with the mansion and estate of Sotterley; the latter is
well known, as borne by a widely extended family circle, who,
having been yet more honourably distinguished as &ldquo;the
children of the covenant, for four or five generations,&rdquo;
have not suffered &ldquo;the entail to be cut off.&rdquo; <a
name="citation167a"></a><a href="#footnote167a"
class="citation">[167a]</a>&nbsp; The record adds, &ldquo;Mr.
Crispe was baptized before his receiving in.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The next pastor was <span class="smcap">Mr. William
Nokes</span>.&nbsp; In the spring of 1688, he was at the
University of Utrecht, surrounded by a constellation of men
afterwards distinguished by their talents and usefulness; and in
a situation to avail himself of the academical instructions of
Witsius, and other eminent professors of divinity. <a
name="citation167b"></a><a href="#footnote167b"
class="citation">[167b]</a>&nbsp; The eloquent <a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>Saurin was
at that time officiating in the French church at Utrecht.&nbsp;
But the students from this country had less dainty fare on the
Lord&rsquo;s day, the minister of the English church being a
Dutchman, who spoke the language very imperfectly, and who,
though an honest and good man, was an indifferent preacher.&nbsp;
Dr. Calamy mentions this circumstance, as well as the Dutch and
French examples of laxity with reference to the sabbath, and the
want of discipline in the University, as &ldquo;very
disadvantageous to the moral character and mental improvement of
the English students.&rdquo; <a name="citation168a"></a><a
href="#footnote168a" class="citation">[168a]</a></p>
<p>It does not appear that Mr. Nokes had the charge of a
congregation prior to his coming to Beccles.&nbsp; Nor is the
exact date of that event known. <a name="citation168b"></a><a
href="#footnote168b" class="citation">[168b]</a>&nbsp; It is not
unlikely that he previously resided for some time in London, for
he enjoyed at this period of his life the friendship of Mr.
(afterwards Dr.) Isaac Watts. <a name="citation168c"></a><a
href="#footnote168c" class="citation">[168c]</a>&nbsp; To that
truly <a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>great, and profoundly humble, man, he told (what is
seldom told, but in the patient ear of intimate friendship) the
tale of the &ldquo;days of darkness,&rdquo; which had clouded his
spirit.&nbsp; A description of the state of his mind on religious
subjects, which he committed to blank verse, Watts revised and
amplified, and has preserved among his Lyric Poems.&nbsp; It is
thus introduced: &ldquo;The substance of the following copy, and
many of the lines, were sent me by <i>an esteemed friend</i>, Mr.
W. Nokes, with a desire that I would form them into a Pindaric
ode; but I retained his measures, lest I should too much alter
his sense.&rdquo;&nbsp; The style of poetry is such as fully
authorizes the conclusion, that friendship must have furnished
the chief inducement to Watts to bestow his pains upon it.&nbsp;
The following passages will afford a specimen.</p>
<h3>&ldquo;A SIGHT OF CHRIST. <a name="citation169"></a><a
href="#footnote169" class="citation">[169]</a></h3>
<blockquote><p>. . . . . . . . .</p>
<p>Once I beheld his face, when beams divine<br />
Broke from his eyelids, and unusual light<br />
Wrapt me at once in glory and surprise.<br />
My joyful heart, high leaping in my breast,<br />
<a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>With
transport cried, &lsquo;This is the Christ of God:&rsquo;<br />
Then threw my arms around in sweet embrace,<br />
And clasp&rsquo;d, and bow&rsquo;d, adoring low, till I was lost
in him.</p>
<p>. . . . . .</p>
<p>But the bright shine and presence soon withdrew;<br />
I sought him whom I love, but found him not.<br />
I felt his absence, and with strongest cries<br />
Proclaimed, &lsquo;Where Jesus is not, all is vain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>. . . . . .</p>
<p>Oh that the day, the joyful day, were come,<br />
When the first Adam from his ancient dust<br />
Crown&rsquo;d with new honours, shall revive, and see<br />
Jesus his Son and Lord; while shouting saints<br />
Surround their King, and God&rsquo;s eternal Son<br />
Shines in the midst . . .</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death and the tempter, and the man of
sin,<br />
Now at the bar arraign&rsquo;d, in judgment cast,<br />
Shall vex the saints no more; but perfect love<br />
And loudest praises, perfect joy create,<br />
While ever-circling years proclaim the blissful state.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the same year in which Watts accepted the pastoral office,
he addressed to Mr. Nokes the subjoined lines.&nbsp; The allusion
to the sympathy of minds overwhelmed with floods of sorrow,
renders it probable that Mr. Nokes had already been the subject
of some deep affliction, while his subsequent history induces the
supposition <a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>that it might he somewhat similar to that, which for so
many years deprived Watts&rsquo;s church of his public
services.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou sweet deluding ill,<br />
The brightest minute mortals find,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sharpest hour we feel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Fate has divided all our shares<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of pleasure and of pain;<br />
In love the comforts and the cares<br />

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But whilst in floods our sorrow
rolls<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Serves but to swell our woe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, why should bliss depart in

</blockquote>
<p><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>For
several years the ministry of Mr. Nokes, at Beccles, was attended
with success.</p>
<p>In the early part of 1710, however, there were some things in
him of which his people disapproved; chiefly, it has been
supposed, his disposition to conform.&nbsp; But he was not
hastily or harshly dismissed.&nbsp; The case was submitted to the
ministers of the neighbouring churches in Norfolk and Suffolk,
for their advice. <a name="citation172"></a><a
href="#footnote172" class="citation">[172]</a>&nbsp; The result
was, however, a determination, recorded in <a
name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>the church
book and signed by the deacons and several other members, to
withdraw their communion from him, with a renewed resolution
stedfastly &ldquo;to adhere to their church covenant, and pursue
the common interest of Christ among them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Nokes did not, as has been imagined, immediately
conform.&nbsp; In the same year in which he left Beccles, he
undertook the charge of the congregation at Ropemaker&rsquo;s
Alley, London, which had been for many years under the pastoral
care of Mr. Walter Cross, a minister of considerable attainments.
<a name="citation173a"></a><a href="#footnote173a"
class="citation">[173a]</a></p>
<p>In 1712, Mr. Nokes had a good living given him in the Church
of England, <a name="citation173b"></a><a href="#footnote173b"
class="citation">[173b]</a> which he accepted.&nbsp; Little more
is known of him.&nbsp; Mr. Harmer says, &ldquo;he was afterwards
disordered in his mind, and died in one of the streets of
London;&mdash;<a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Holborn.&rdquo; <a name="citation174"></a><a href="#footnote174"
class="citation">[174]</a></p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>For about a year the church was without a pastor.&nbsp; On the
16th May, 1711, <span class="smcap">Mr. Edmund Spencer</span> was
received into communion with them, preparatory to his assuming
that office.&nbsp; They seem to have been very happy with him for
many years.&nbsp; But growing old and infirm, he received a good
deal of uneasiness from a part of the congregation, who wished
him to resign.&nbsp; The mischief was greatly aggravated through
the undue influence exercised by an individual who introduced
some preachers from a distance.&nbsp; These occupied the pulpit,
while the aged pastor consented to continue preaching in a
private house.&nbsp; The most eminent ministers of Norfolk and
Suffolk evinced the greatest respect for Mr. Spencer, and
expressed their disapprobation of what they regarded as a sad
violation of Christian tenderness.&nbsp; Mr. Spencer was pastor
at Beccles nearly twenty-five years, and died there about
1736.&nbsp; His remains were carried to Norwich, and <a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>deposited
in the Congregational meeting-house, St.
Clement&rsquo;s,&mdash;several of his own people attending.</p>
<p>He left one daughter, who, some time before his death, was
married to a Mr. Pougher, a gentleman of fortune, educated for
the ministry, but who, being blind, lived in a private
capacity.&nbsp; He was a remarkable example of that beautiful
provision of nature, by which the sense of feeling is improved to
such exquisite acuteness, as almost to compensate for the loss of
sight. <a name="citation175a"></a><a href="#footnote175a"
class="citation">[175a]</a></p>
<p>At a meeting held 13th March, 1722&ndash;3, John Utting and
Philip Lefabuer were ordained to the office of deacons
&ldquo;without imposition of hands.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mr. Spencer was succeeded by <span class="smcap">Mr. Thomas
Tingey</span>, a son of Mr. Tingey, first of Northampton,
afterwards of Fetter-lane, London. <a name="citation175b"></a><a
href="#footnote175b" class="citation">[175b]</a>&nbsp; He had
pursued his studies at the academy in London, under Dr.
Ridgley.</p>
<p>Mr. Tingey, the subject of this notice, preached his first
sermon &ldquo;in Mr. Russell&rsquo;s place,&rdquo; <a
name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>from Jerem.
i. 6, &ldquo;Then said I, Ah, Lord God; behold I cannot speak,
for I am a child.&rdquo;&nbsp; On which occasion he &ldquo;gave
uncommon content and satisfaction,&rdquo; and his friends were
encouraged to look forward with sanguine expectations of his
future instrumentality in promoting the glory of God, and the
salvation of souls. <a name="citation176a"></a><a
href="#footnote176a" class="citation">[176a]</a></p>
<p>About 1730, he settled with the congregation at Lower
Rotherhithe, as successor to Mr. Thomas Masters.&nbsp; He is
described as possessing at that time good pulpit talents,
combined with too much self-esteem and instability of character.
<a name="citation176b"></a><a href="#footnote176b"
class="citation">[176b]</a>&nbsp; But he was a young man, and
there was reason to hope that time and experience would correct
these failings.</p>
<p>On the 27th August, 1736, he was united to the church at
Beccles; and on the 8th of the following month was ordained as
its pastor, with the laying on of hands.</p>
<p>Mr. Nathaniel Newton, who appears to have been an active
deacon nearly forty-four years, <a name="page177"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 177</span>died 12th June, 1739, and was buried
in the meeting-house.</p>
<p>Mr. Tingey married in March, 1738, and continued at Beccles
till his death, but the congregation declined in numbers under
his ministry, and some who had adopted antip&aelig;do-baptist
sentiments withdrew, and formed a distinct church. <a
name="citation177"></a><a href="#footnote177"
class="citation">[177]</a></p>
<p>Mr. Tingey was generally considered a good preacher; but
during the last few years of his life he was induced to involve
himself in secular business, which tended to lower him in the
esteem of the professing world.</p>
<p><a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>He
died about October, 1749, <a name="citation178a"></a><a
href="#footnote178a" class="citation">[178a]</a> and was interred
in the burial-ground adjoining the meeting-house.&nbsp; A stone
was erected to his memory, the inscription upon which, so far as
it is now legible, is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">HERE LIETH THE BODY<br

. . .</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>From
that time to Midsummer, 1757, the congregation was supplied by
<span class="smcap">Mr. William Lincoln</span>.&nbsp; He had
become a student in the academy at Northampton under Dr.
Doddridge, in 1745, and came from thence to Beccles.&nbsp;
Afterwards he removed to Bury St. Edmunds; was ordained pastor of
the congregation assembling in Churchgate street in that town,
September 7th, 1757; and died there April 22nd, 1792, at the age
of sixty-four. <a name="citation179a"></a><a href="#footnote179a"
class="citation">[179a]</a></p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>After Mr. Lincoln left Beccles, various ministers occupied the
pulpit some months; particularly <span class="smcap">Mr. John
Hurrion</span>, a grandson of Mr. Hurrion, first of Denton, and
afterwards of Harecourt, London, and son of Mr. Samuel Hurrion,
of Guestwick. <a name="citation179b"></a><a href="#footnote179b"
class="citation">[179b]</a>&nbsp; He became, in August, 1761, <a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>pastor of
the Independent church at Southwold, where he died much
respected, March 13th, 1793, aged fifty-six.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In the autumn of 1758, <span class="smcap">Mr. Nicholas
Phen&eacute;</span>, who had been a student in the Hoxton
Academy, came to Beccles.&nbsp; He continued here as a supply for
about two years, and then went to Rendham, in Suffolk, where he
was ordained June 6th, 1761.&nbsp; He again removed in 1764, to
Gloucester, and afterwards to Bradford, Wiltshire, and died in
1773.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>For many months subsequent to the Michaelmas of 1760,
occasional ministers were engaged at Beccles.&nbsp; During
several succeeding years, the pulpit was occupied by an
individual whose talents and writings have rendered him eminent
in the dissenting community.&nbsp; This was <span
class="smcap">Mr. John Fell</span>.</p>
<p>He was born at Cockermouth, in Cumberland, August 22nd,
1735.&nbsp; From his father, a pious schoolmaster, he received an
education suitable for the station of a humble tradesman, for
which he was intended.&nbsp; But the son afforded an example <a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>of natural
talent, and indefatigable industry, combining with providential
circumstances, to surmount all the difficulties which lie in the
path to useful and honourable distinction.&nbsp; Removing to
London that he might improve in his business, he happily
connected himself with a master who could appreciate his solid
abilities and literary taste.&nbsp; It was soon discovered that
his highest ambition was to become a christian minister; and with
the assistance of some gentlemen of wealth and philanthropy, he
was placed at the Independent academy at Mile-end.&nbsp; He there
applied to study with such incessant diligence, that his progress
soon excited the admiration of his tutors and
fellow-students.&nbsp; Quitting the academy with an unusual share
of attainments, but having no immediate prospect of settling with
a congregation, Mr. Fell became assistant in a school at
Norwich.&nbsp; There he probably remained until he was invited,
in 1762, to remove to Beccles to supply the vacant pulpit.&nbsp;
He found the congregation few in number, but affectionate in
private, and serious and attentive in public.</p>
<p><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>During his residence in Beccles, he was cordially
received into what is termed &ldquo;the best
society.&rdquo;&nbsp; He evinced the greatest charity and candour
towards those whose views of religion he could not approve; and
while he associated with the advocates of the Established church,
he never hesitated to avow his ardent and unalterable attachment
to the interests of civil and religious liberty.&nbsp; His
manners were frank, easy, and unaffected, and his conversation
cheerful, interesting, and instructive.&nbsp; He did not allow
his quick penetration and his readiness of utterance to betray
him into dogmatism or parade: and he knew how to defend himself,
with point and humour, from such an imputation.&nbsp; Falling
accidentally into company with Dr. King of Harecourt, London,
that serious, but cheerful minister rallied him upon his alleged
sprightliness of wit and acuteness of criticism.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, young man,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I hear you are a
critic;&mdash;pray, sir, how do you define a critic?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; replied Mr. Fell, &ldquo;I never did define
a critic; but if I were to attempt it, I think I should say, he
is one who labours to make <i>easy</i> things <a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span><i>difficult</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; An answer which is said
to have occasioned some amusement at the expense of the
aggressor.</p>
<p>Mr. Fell had a lively, energetic delivery; and his sermons,
though always the result of hard study, were extempore.&nbsp; He
received an invitation to become the settled pastor of the
congregation at Beccles.&nbsp; But as they had long been without
any regular church government, were few in number, and the
prospect of an increase not, at that time, very encouraging, he
declined the proposal.</p>
<p>In May, 1770, he visited, with a view to the pastoral charge,
the Independent congregation at Thaxted, in Essex.&nbsp; There he
was ordained in the following October, and soon made himself
useful and beloved.&nbsp; But he was calculated for a sphere of
usefulness wider, or at least more difficult to fill, than the
charge of a country congregation.&nbsp; After several
years&rsquo; residence at Thaxted, he was prevailed on to become
the resident classical tutor at the academy in which he had been
educated for the ministry, and which had been removed, in 1770,
to Homerton.&nbsp; He had <a name="page184"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 184</span>not been long there, before a
misunderstanding occurred which terminated in his
dismissal.&nbsp; In this affair, the conduct of his adversaries
appears to have been not unmingled with severity.&nbsp; Several
highly respectable persons who were of this opinion, raised an
annual stipend of &pound;100, for which he was to deliver a
course of twelve lectures on the evidences of Christianity.&nbsp;
He entered zealously upon this task in the year 1797, but had
only delivered four lectures, when death interfered with the
completion of the plan.&nbsp; He expired on the 6th, and was
interred in Bunhillfields on the 15th September in that year, his
remains being followed by a train of fourteen mourning coaches
and several carriages.</p>
<p>Besides the four lectures before mentioned, (which were
continued by Dr. Henry Hunter,) and several other publications,
he was the author of answers to the Rev. Hugh Farmer&rsquo;s
Essays on the Demoniacs and on the Idolatry of Greece and Rome;
in which productions he displayed much acuteness and learning. <a
name="citation184"></a><a href="#footnote184"
class="citation">[184]</a></p>
<p><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>After
Mr. Fell&rsquo;s removal to Thaxted, Mr. Newton of Norwich, Mr.
Harmer of Wattisfield, and other ministers; continued to preach
at Beccles; and the congregation had for rather more than half a
year preceding midsummer, 1771, the services of a Mr. Cole.&nbsp;
It is surmised that this must have been the learned <span
class="smcap">Baxter Cole</span>, who, prior to 1765, was morning
preacher to the congregation in Rope-makers&rsquo; alley, London,
of which the Rev. Thomas Towle was pastor.&nbsp; In that year he
went to Wymondham, in Norfolk, where he preached till May,
1766.&nbsp; He never undertook any pastoral charge; but was a
close student, and superintended the printing of an edition of
Dr. Lardner&rsquo;s Works.&nbsp; He also revised some of the
publications of the truly great Howard.&nbsp; Mr. Cole died at
Sible Hedingham, in Essex, his native county, Oct. 13th, 1794, at
an advanced age.&nbsp; He was a firm dissenter and Independent, a
strenuous assertor of civil and religious liberty; and a man of
considerable attainments, of the strictest integrity, and true
piety. <a name="citation185"></a><a href="#footnote185"
class="citation">[185]</a></p>
<p><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>But
although the preaching of the gospel had been maintained with
little intermission during the long period which had elapsed from
Mr. Tingey&rsquo;s decease, the church had suffered much for want
of a stated pastor.&nbsp; Member after member had been removed by
death, and none were added.&nbsp; In the meeting-house, where the
remnant of the people usually worshipped, the Lord&rsquo;s supper
had not been administered for more than twenty years.&nbsp; No
regular discipline had been kept up; and the interest itself
seemed on the point of expiring.&nbsp; But it pleased God in
answer to many prayers, to shine upon the decaying cause, and to
unfold a new and more cheering era of its
history.&mdash;&ldquo;Happy assembly above, which knows no
diminution, but rejoices in perpetual accessions to its numbers,
perhaps in continual additions to its knowledge and consolations
too!&rdquo; <a name="citation186"></a><a href="#footnote186"

<p><span class="smcap">Joseph Heptinstall</span>, pastor of the
Independent church at Beccles from 1773 to 1802, was born at
Walsall, in Staffordshire, January 26th, 1742.&nbsp; He was
blessed with a pious and tender mother, who often took him into
her closet, and on her knees prayed fervently to God on his
behalf.&nbsp; Her supplications were not immediately
answered.&nbsp; At the early age of twelve years, her son
manifested the depravity of his nature, by avowing himself an
atheist.&nbsp; But being providentially led to contemplate a
flower in his father&rsquo;s garden, he was convinced that its
beautiful <a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>structure must have been the work of a First Cause,
that created and sustains all things.&nbsp; Conscience, in
conjunction with the sacred Scriptures, impressively taught him
that this Being was holy and just, and therefore would approve
and reward holiness, and abhor and punish sin.&nbsp; These
convictions led him to seek salvation &ldquo;by the works of the
law;&rdquo; but he mentions that about this time, he read
Law&rsquo;s &ldquo;Christian Perfection,&rdquo; and imbibed more
correct views of the purity and spirituality of the divine
commands.&nbsp; Comparing his conduct with them, he was convinced
of the awful state to which sin had reduced him, and greatly
alarmed at the consequences of rebelling against God.&nbsp; With
a mind thus depressed and agitated, he repaired to the throne of
grace, imploring the mercy of God, and pleading his promises
through the Mediator.&nbsp; He derived much consolation from that
important passage of Scripture, &ldquo;Believe on the Lord Jesus
Christ, and thou shalt be saved.&rdquo;&nbsp; Being enabled by
the Holy Spirit to receive the gospel, he enjoyed peace with God,
and the happiness of those to whom iniquity is not imputed.&nbsp;
He <a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>now
began to consider how he might best glorify God, and serve him in
the world; and determined, in the strength of God, to devote
himself to the christian ministry.&nbsp; This resolution met with
the warmest approbation of his parents.&nbsp; They were zealous
advocates of the religious establishment of this country, and had
the means of amply providing for their son within its pale,
through an aunt, who readily promised him a living of which she
had the patronage.</p>
<p>With these views he commenced a preparatory course of study
for the University of Oxford, where at the age of seventeen he
was to have been admitted.&nbsp; Meanwhile he wisely examined the
Thirty-nine Articles, which he would have been called upon to
subscribe.&nbsp; He appears to have hesitated with regard to that
&ldquo;Of Predestination and Election;&rdquo; and he was
unwilling to recognise as a part of his creed, a doctrine which,
at that time, was not so in reality.&nbsp; On the other hand he
was much distressed at the idea of relinquishing his intention to
become a minister; and, in his estimation, to abandon the church
of England was the same, for hitherto nothing had <a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>ever
induced him to cross the threshold of a dissenting
meeting-house.</p>
<p>In this unsettled state of mind he was introduced to an aged
gentleman, to whom he imparted his feelings, and who was the
means of removing not only his objections to the doctrine of
election, but also his prejudices against dissent.&nbsp; In
consequence of this conversation he relinquished all thoughts of
Oxford, and after a short time entered the Independent academy at
Mile-end, afterwards at Homerton, <a name="citation190a"></a><a
href="#footnote190a" class="citation">[190a]</a> in which he
remained upwards of seven years. <a name="citation190b"></a><a
href="#footnote190b" class="citation">[190b]</a></p>
<p>About midsummer, 1771, having finished his studies, he visited
Beccles, by the advice of his friend the Rev. Thomas Towle, with
the hope of being instrumental in reviving and re-organizing the
almost expiring interest.&nbsp; There remained of Mr.
Tingey&rsquo;s church only four members, one of <a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>whom was
his widow.&nbsp; Another who was residing at Bury, communicated,
through Mr. Harmer of Wattisfield, his acquiescence in the
arrangements of his brethren.</p>
<p>On the 8th May, 1772, the Rev. Thomas Bocking of Denton, with
two messengers from the church under his care, attended at
Beccles; and in their presence, three persons, <a
name="citation191"></a><a href="#footnote191"
class="citation">[191]</a> on a profession of their faith in
Christ, were admitted to a participation with the small remnant
of the church in the privileges of christian fellowship.&nbsp; On
the following day Mr. Bocking administered to them the
Lord&rsquo;s supper, when also another member was admitted, under
a testimonial from the church of Scotland.</p>
<p>On the 15th May, 1773, Mr. Heptinstall received a unanimous
invitation from the church and congregation, to become their
pastor, which he accepted; and on the 27th July he was ordained
over them, &ldquo;to the great consolation of the neighbouring
churches and ministers.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>The
services were introduced by Mr. Bocking. <a
name="citation192"></a><a href="#footnote192"
class="citation">[192]</a>&nbsp; Referring to the interest
evinced by the elders of other religious societies on this
occasion, he disclaimed on their behalf any pretensions to
ecclesiastical authority.&nbsp; &ldquo;In truth,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;there is no power in the church but what is ministerial;
which, as it comes from Jesus Christ, is revealed in the
Scriptures, and there stands as a directory both of faith and
manners.&nbsp; We deny that the &lsquo;church hath power to
decree rites or ceremonies, and authority in controversies of
faith,&rsquo; most heartily adhering to this description, that
&lsquo;the visible church of Christ is a congregation of faithful
men, in which the pure word of God is preached, and the
sacraments be duly ministered according to Christ&rsquo;s
ordinance, in all those things that of necessity are requisite to
the same.&rsquo;&rdquo; . . . &ldquo;Happy will it be,&rdquo; he
added, &ldquo;if former neglects and untoward circumstances
should be improved for greater diligence, and the lamp which was
just out, should so revive, as to burn with a steady and
persevering flame.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>These
anticipations were mercifully realized.&nbsp; In 1779 the number
of communicants was augmented to thirty-six, and in 1785 to
forty-six; and Mr. Heptinstall had the happiness to preside over
an increasing and harmonious church to the end of his days.</p>
<p>He had a fine clear voice, and his general delivery was
unaffected and impressive.&nbsp; It was his object, in all his
sermons, to pour contempt on human pride, that in every case self
might be disclaimed and Christ alone exalted.&nbsp; He was a
Calvinist from conviction, and wherever he addressed a
congregation, he never failed to declare salvation to be entirely
of grace,&mdash;the unmerited gift of God.</p>
<p>He was firm in his attachment to religious liberty, and ready,
on proper occasions, with gratitude and animation, to point out
its value to others.</p>
<p>But while he was decided in his own sentiments, he was
distinguished by his candour, moderation, and benevolence,
towards those who differed from him.&nbsp; His example served, in
a great measure, to diffuse the same spirit through <a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>his own
congregation, and to promote a friendly intercourse with persons
of other denominations.</p>
<p>He possessed much generosity of disposition towards the
poor.&nbsp; But he was far from regarding this manifestation of
christian principle as the ground of his acceptance in the sight
of God.&nbsp; On the contrary, his mind was constantly impressed
with the deepest sense of his personal guilt, so that it might be
said of him, that he abhorred himself, and daily repented in dust
and ashes.</p>
<p>The late venerable pastor of the neighbouring Congregational
church at Bungay, the Rev. Robert Shufflebottom, who knew him
long and intimately, always mentioned him as a brother greatly
beloved. <a name="citation194"></a><a href="#footnote194"
class="citation">[194]</a>&nbsp; He lived many years under the
fear that, in his conflict with the last enemy, he should
dishonour the cause of his Lord and <a name="page195"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 195</span>Master.&nbsp; This state of mind was
probably aggravated by profuse bleedings at the nose, which
weakened his frame and broke his spirits.&nbsp; It was his
earnest wish not to remain longer in the body, than he could
preach the glad tidings of salvation to perishing sinners.&nbsp;
More than once he expressed a wish to die either in the pulpit or
soon after leaving it.</p>
<p>This desire was granted.&nbsp; On the morning of the
Lord&rsquo;s day, August 29th, 1802, he arose in his usual
health, and performed the public service with his accustomed
energy.&nbsp; But on leaving the pulpit he complained of violent
headache, which after dinner had increased to such a degree, as
to be attended almost with loss of sight.&nbsp; In vain were
expostulations used with him not to attempt the afternoon
service.&nbsp; Thinking he should feel better after he had begun
preaching, he again ascended the pulpit, read a chapter with
evident difficulty, and took for his text that memorable passage,
John i. 29, &ldquo;Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the
sin of the world!&rdquo;&nbsp; His impaired vision preventing the
use of his notes, he preached extempore <a

an hour, and closed the public worship of the day with the most
impressive prayer his congregation had ever heard from his
lips.&nbsp; A few minutes only had elapsed before his
recollection failed.&nbsp; After he was taken home, he spoke only
once, referring to the pain in his head and begging for
assistance.&nbsp; He continued in a state of stupor till about
seven o&rsquo;clock in the evening, when he gave signs of
returning reason, by pressing the hand of his afflicted
partner.&nbsp; About ten o&rsquo;clock he closed his earthly
sabbath, by entering upon that which is eternal. <a

<p>On the following sunday afternoon, the Rev. H. W. Gardiner of
Southwold delivered an impressive discourse upon the occasion,
from Phil. ii. 16, &ldquo;Holding forth the word of life, that I
may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain,
neither laboured in vain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His remains were interred in the church-yard of Mutford, near
those of his wife&rsquo;s relatives.&nbsp; A small monument was
erected in the meeting-house to his memory.&nbsp; It describes
him as having laboured &ldquo;in the christian ministry with <a
name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>fidelity
and success.&rdquo;&nbsp; The inscription upon his grave-stone is
as follows:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The sudden removal of their excellent minister was deeply felt
by the church and congregation, and earnest prayer was presented,
that the dispensation might be sanctified, and the stroke
healed.&nbsp; In the month of November, God was pleased to
introduce among them their late admirable pastor.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p><a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span><span
class="smcap">Isaac Sloper</span> was born at Devizes, in
Wiltshire, May 30th, 1779, and was baptized soon after, by the
Rev. Rowland Hill.&nbsp; His parents, though not distinguished by
rank or riches, were endowed with those honours which come from
above, and died in the well-founded hope of the &ldquo;crown of
glory which fadeth not away.&rdquo;&nbsp; He received his early
instructions under the Rev. J. L. Fenner, the Presbyterian
minister at Devizes, afterwards of Taunton, in Somersetshire,
where he died in 1834, greatly advanced in life.</p>
<p>In April, 1794, Mr. Sloper left his father&rsquo;s house, and
was placed as a clerk in the office of Mr. Richard Pruen, an
attorney at Cheltenham.&nbsp; Of this period of life his private
papers contain the following interesting account.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;During my residence at Cheltenham the
serious impressions which I had acquired from the example,
instruction, and prayers of my parents, were almost entirely
destroyed.&nbsp; Though I verified the assertion of the wise man,
&lsquo;The way of transgressors is hard,&rsquo; in process of
time my conscience would more easily permit me to neglect prayer
and the Scriptures, think lightly of <a name="page199"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 199</span>the sabbath, and prefer the society
of the gay and dissipated to that of persons religions and
grave.&nbsp; To the brink of ruin was I hurried . . .&nbsp; But
my destruction was prevented by an omnipotent arm, and sovereign
grace.&nbsp; By reflection and a serious train of thought, I was
convinced of my excessive folly and irreligious conduct.&nbsp; I
was enabled to betake myself to prayer, and to pay a diligent
regard to the other means of grace.&nbsp; At first my convictions
were attended with much dejection of mind, and fears concerning
the important matters of my soul, of death and eternity.&nbsp;
But the God of all grace soon permitted me to experience that the
ways of true religion are &lsquo;ways of pleasantness,&rsquo; and
that all &lsquo;her paths are peace.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brought to see the evil of sin, and to feel the
importance of true religion for the present life, and for a
future state, I possessed a strong desire to devote myself to the
solemn and arduous work of the christian ministry, that I might
labour to convince my fellow-creatures of their danger, and
invite them to receive the grace of the blessed <a
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>Redeemer,
and seek the honours, riches, and happiness of
eternity.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under these impressions, Mr. Sloper turned his thoughts
towards one who was ever the willing, affectionate, and judicious
adviser of pious youth,&mdash;the truly Reverend Cornelius
Winter, of Painswick.&nbsp; While he was expressing, in a letter
to this excellent man, his views and inclinations, Mr. Winter
went to Cheltenham on a visit to Sir Richard Hill.&nbsp; He
favoured Mr. Sloper with several interviews; and at one of them
introduced, in the course of conversation, the very subject which
was uppermost in the mind of his young friend.&nbsp; When
informed of the purport of the letter which Mr. Sloper had partly
written to him, he was struck with the singularity of the
circumstance, and proposed corresponding on the subject in
question.&nbsp; Several letters were exchanged.&nbsp; The value
of the advice which Mr. Sloper had secured, and its probable
influence upon his future character, conduct, and circumstances,
will be best estimated from the following extracts.</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>&ldquo;My ever dear Isaac,</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you had not been peculiarly near to me, I could not
have spared a moment for you to-day.&nbsp; Your desire has more
weight with me than a command would have from many of your
superiors.&nbsp; I therefore drop you a hasty line, to exhort you
to give yourself unto prayer; to watch and wait for the openings
of providence; and to be fully satisfied, upon the strictest and
narrowest examination, that you stand prepared for all the
difficulties of the gospel ministry, as well as to be disposed to
promise yourself all the comforts it affords, in conjunction with
the improvement preparatory to it.&nbsp; I am truly glad you can
lay yourself unreservedly open to <i>Him</i> who seeth and
knoweth all things, even the secret recesses of the soul, and the
spring and motive of every action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you will find some difficulty to get disengaged
from Mr. P.&nbsp; I need not say, behave handsomely upon the
occasion; and while you are firm in your resolution, be
prudent.&nbsp; You remind me of the great difficulty I was under
when a young man; how sanguine, and consequently, <a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>how
restless to carry my point.&nbsp; Though, in fact, it was
God&rsquo;s point I could not move in my own time, nor in my own
way. <a name="citation202"></a><a href="#footnote202"
class="citation">[202]</a>&nbsp; Your line is drawn, and you will
be that which God would have you.&nbsp; Maintain communion with
him, and when he hides his face, beg him to show you the cause,
that your humiliation may be in proportion to the sin he means to
resent.&nbsp; Remember, my dear fellow, that there are seasons
wherein faith must be called into exercise, that when you talk of
faith, you may talk by experience.&nbsp; At all times look unto
Jesus; and when you cannot look immediately to him, look after
him.&nbsp; Resist that enemy, stedfast in the faith, who is
permitted to buffet you; and every blow he gives you will recoil
upon himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may be sure I will keep the object in <a
name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>view.&nbsp;
I am praying for direction, and as directed, will act . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can add no more than a heart full of good wishes, and
my constant prayers.&nbsp; You are interested in these, because I
am, my ever dear Isaac,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Yours very affectionately,<br />
in our dear Lord Jesus,<br />
<span class="smcap">Cornelius Winter</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Painswick</span>,<br />
<i>Jan.</i> 21, 1797.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again in the month of April of the same year: &ldquo;What a
mercy we have a God, such a God, to whom we can commit
ourselves.&nbsp; My dearest Isaac, let him be your God for ever
and ever.&nbsp; Serve him as a real Christian while you live,
though you should never serve him as a minister in his
church.&nbsp; Watch the footsteps of his providence, and let him
have the disposal of you.&nbsp; He can do nothing wrong.&nbsp; He
has all his plans before him, and he is very wise and exact in
the execution of them.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>It was at length determined that Mr. Sloper should apply for
admittance into the academy <a name="page204"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 204</span>at Homerton; and in October, 1797,
he was received into that institution.&nbsp; There were then
fourteen students, and the tutors were Dr. Fisher and the Rev.
John Berry.</p>
<p>Early in the summer of 1798, Mr. Sloper was admitted a member
of the church at Stepney, under the pastoral care of the Rev.
George Ford, whose ministry proved truly beneficial to him.</p>
<p>Towards the close of the year 1799, Mr. Berry resigned his
office as resident tutor, and was succeeded by Mr. (now Dr.) John
Pye Smith, to whose invaluable instructions and uniform
friendship Mr. Sloper felt himself under the greatest
obligations.</p>
<p>His conduct as a student was truly exemplary, and, as may
generally be observed, laid a foundation for that high
respectability of character which he manifested in his future
life.</p>
<p>At the close of his preparatory studies, he was requested,
through the Rev. Samuel Newton of Norwich, to spend a few
probationary weeks at Beccles.&nbsp; Accordingly, Nov. 5th, 1802,
he left London for that purpose, and delivered his first sermon
at Beccles on Sunday, Nov. 7th.&nbsp; After <a
name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>preaching
to the people six sabbath days, he was requested to return to
them for a longer season, with a view to becoming their stated
minister.&nbsp; In the month of February, 1803, he consequently
came again to Beccles, and in the following April an invitation
from the church was presented to him to become their pastor,
which was accepted by Mr. Sloper, on Sunday, 8th May, and was
followed on the 7th July by his public and solemn ordination.</p>
<p>On that occasion, Mr. Sheppard of Wrentham, commenced the
service with prayer and reading of the Scriptures.&nbsp; Mr.
Walford of Yarmouth, delivered an introductory discourse, on
ordination, as practised among protestant dissenters; asked the
usual questions of the minister; and received his confession of
faith.&nbsp; Mr. Newton of Norwich, offered up the ordination
prayer, which was unaccompanied by imposition of hands.&nbsp; Mr.
Ford of Stepney, gave the charge, from Col. iv. 17.&nbsp; Mr. Ray
of Sudbury, preached to the people, from 1 Cor. xvi. 10.&nbsp;
Mr. Shufflebottom of Bungay, Mr. Gardiner of Southwold, and Mr.
Craig of Bocking, engaged in other parts <a
name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>of the
service; and Mr. Atkinson of Ipswich, preached in the
evening.&nbsp; More than twenty ministers were present. <a
name="citation206"></a><a href="#footnote206"
class="citation">[206]</a></p>
<p>The important union thus formed and recognised, was, on the
16th of August, in the same year, followed by Mr. Sloper&rsquo;s
marriage; and both events were productive of felicity, for which,
to his very last days, he constantly blessed God.</p>
<p>After his ordination his ministry created considerable
attention; the congregation gradually increased; and through the
divine blessing, his preaching was rendered effectual to the
conversion of some, and to the improvement and comfort of
many.</p>
<p>Previously to Mr. Sloper&rsquo;s pastorate, it was usual in
this, as in many other Congregational churches, for persons
desiring to unite with the society, to send in a written account
of their christian experience.&nbsp; And it was also customary to
hold three church meetings before the reception of a
candidate.&nbsp; In December, 1803, as prudence did not appear to
require a rigid adherence <a name="page207"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 207</span>to these regulations, it was agreed,
at a church meeting, that the writing a paper should be left to
the inclination of the candidates, and that they should in future
be proposed at one meeting, and received, or rejected, at the
next. <a name="citation207a"></a><a href="#footnote207a"
class="citation">[207a]</a></p>
<p>In 1804, a secession of a few members took place.&nbsp; They
formed the nucleus of the Baptist church which has since existed
in Beccles. <a name="citation207b"></a><a href="#footnote207b"
class="citation">[207b]</a></p>
<p><a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>Mr.
Sloper was visited in the same year with an indisposition, which
occasioned his absence for six weeks.&nbsp; During this
affliction he had ample proof of the affection of his
people.&nbsp; Prayer-meetings were held for the special purpose
of imploring the blessing of God on the means employed for his
recovery, and upon his ministry when he should resume it.&nbsp;
These supplications were graciously regarded, and he was enabled
again to preach very frequently, and with much success, till
October, 1806, when it pleased God to afflict him with typhus
fever.&nbsp; This illness lasted till the middle of December, and
at times was attended with considerable danger.&nbsp; He
observes, &ldquo;It produced a great dejection of spirits, and
dread of death; but goodness and mercy attended me every
moment.&nbsp; My affliction excited in the minds of my people,
and fellow-townsmen, general concern; and, I believe, was the
means of strengthening the mutual affection that exists <a
name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>between my
charge and their minister.&nbsp; The kindness of my congregation
and friends on this occasion, I trust, will not soon be erased
from my recollection, or my heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; He makes no
allusion to the cause of his illness.&nbsp; It originated from
his attention to an afflicted individual.&nbsp; The house of
sickness and mourning was never forsaken by him; and there was a
tenderness of sympathy in his manner, and a glowing affection in
his heart, which were very soothing to the afflicted.&nbsp; He
regarded visiting the sick as an important duty, and expressly
consulted his friend, Mr. Winter, on the best mode of discharging
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;I generally,&rdquo; said that excellent man in
his reply, &ldquo;endeavour to be very serious in prayer;&rdquo;
<a name="citation209"></a><a href="#footnote209"
class="citation">[209]</a> and Mr. Sloper did not fail to profit
by this suggestion.&nbsp; His prayers in seasons of trial were
peculiarly touching and appropriate.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1807, he took a journey for the purpose of
visiting his distant relations and friends.&nbsp; He met again,
at that time, his early and venerated friend, Mr. Winter.&nbsp;
The tie which connected them had been doubled by Mr. <a
name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
210</span>Sloper&rsquo;s alliance with one who in early life had
been much with that holy and benevolent man&mdash;one of his
numerous &ldquo;children by adoption and kindness.&rdquo;&nbsp;
About two months previous to the attack which terminated his
useful life, he wrote to her as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My very dear daughter,</p>
<p>I sit down purposely to write something to you.&nbsp; I wish
it may be something profitable; for otherwise a letter is nothing
worth . . .</p>
<p>I am disappointed at not seeing more genuine religion produced
by my labours.&nbsp; Some I hope fear God, and walk before him,
but many are so irregular in their walk, that I fear for
them.&nbsp; I hope matters are different at Beccles.&nbsp; I find
the short time since I was there has produced changes.&nbsp; Some
have quitted the stage of life, and left vacant seats in the
house of God; . . . yet our dear friend has a considerable number
by which his hands are strengthened.&nbsp; Oh that they may be
his present joy, and his future crown of rejoicing! . . . I need
not say, consecrate yourselves to God; keep the mind heavenwards;
let <a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>your
friends see that you live upon the suburbs of the heavenly
kingdom.&nbsp; Do not let the world engross you in any
degree.&nbsp; Whether it smile or frown, be alike indifferent to
it.&nbsp; Conceive of it as it is, fleeting and uncertain.&nbsp;
Take the refreshments provided for and suited to the pilgrim; but
do not set up your rest where you should only bait.&nbsp; Prepare
to meet your God. . . .&nbsp; My good wife is as well as may be
expected, and so is Mrs. Tyler, to whom we are much indebted for
her kind exertions.&nbsp; They unite in salutations to you and my
son, from whom I shall ever be glad to receive a line.&nbsp; If
he will commission you to use his pen, and you will accept the
commission, it will be equally and very acceptable to</p>
<p style="text-align: right">My ever dear daughter,<br />
Your very affectionate father,<br />
<span class="smcap">Cornelius Winter</span>.&rdquo; <a
name="citation211"></a><a href="#footnote211"
class="citation">[211]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Painswick</span>,<br />
<i>Oct.</i> 16, 1807.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To the death of this greatly esteemed friend, Mr. Sloper thus
tenderly refers in his private papers.&nbsp; &ldquo;January 10th,
1808, that excellent <a name="page212"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 212</span>man, that eminent Christian and
minister, Rev. Cornelius Winter, was removed by death to his
eternal home.&nbsp; His decease seriously impressed my mind, and
drew from me the tear of selfish regret, that I should receive no
more instruction from his lips, nor ever more be delighted with
his pious conversation, fervent prayers, and affectionate
intercourse.&nbsp; Oh may the son who now writes concerning his
honoured father and friend, possess a measure of his spirit and
imitate his holy example.&nbsp; His image is impressed upon the
hearts of all who knew him; and his heavenly portrait, painted by
the hand of his adopted son, the worthy and eloquent Mr. Jay,
will be held up for the admiration and regard of succeeding
generations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following interesting reflections and solemn prayer, found
among the same papers, under the date of January 3rd, 1809,
deserve to be introduced here.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;By the grace of God I am spared to the
commencement of another year.&nbsp; I would begin it with serious
reflection on the past, and with humble prayer as it concerns
futurity.</p>
<p><a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
213</span>&ldquo;Many of my fellow-creatures have commenced this
year in the world of spirits.&nbsp; They have done with time and
with all its concerns.&nbsp; Their season for gaining and doing
good is closed for ever.&nbsp; But God has prolonged my
existence, and, during the past year, distinguished me with his
goodness and mercy.&nbsp; Upon the whole my health this year has
been much improved: as a minister, I have been enabled to exert
myself considerably in the preaching of the gospel: the
congregation has been large; and a few, the fruit of my ministry,
have been added to the church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My domestic comforts have been great.&nbsp; My house
has been the seat of <i>health</i>, <i>affection</i>, and
<i>peace</i>.&nbsp; Here I would raise my
Ebenezer,&mdash;&lsquo;Hitherto the Lord hath helped
me,&rsquo;&mdash;and turn my reflections into prayer to the great
Preserver of my being.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O thou God of grace, in whom I live and move
continually, help thy servant to prostrate himself before thy
throne; and hear the faithful acknowledgments which he desires to
offer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank thee for all thy favours which thou hast
bestowed upon me ever since I came into <a
name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>the world:
for preservation in the midst of dangers; for restoration from
sickness to health; but, above all, for a religious education;
for the wise conduct of thy superintending providence, and for
thy distinguishing grace in calling me from the follies of the
world into the family of thy children, and into the ministry of
thy dear Son.&nbsp; I thank thee, O God, for all the privileges
of the past year, for all my exemption from affliction and pain,
for the strength which I have possessed for the performance of
every duty as the head of a family, and as the minister of a
congregation.&nbsp; I thank thee, O Lord, for the happiness I
enjoy at home, and for the peace that prevails among the people
of my charge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But whilst thou art worthy to receive the warmest
returns of gratitude for thy goodness towards me, I would, on a
recollection of my conduct, with contrition humble myself before
thee.&nbsp; Merciful God! forgive my pride and vanity of heart;
forgive my levity of speech and behaviour, my lukewarmness in thy
service, and every error and defect which have been found in the
exercises I have performed.&nbsp; From a consciousness <a
name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>of my many
imperfections I would throw myself entirely on thy compassion,
praying with the publican, &lsquo;God be merciful to me a
sinner!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shouldst thou spare me, O God, through the year upon
which I have entered, O spare me for the benefit of my own soul,
for the good of others, and for thy glory.&nbsp; Enable me to
read thy word, and to study it with attention and delight: help
me to maintain the spirit and practice of devotion in my closet,
in my family, and in the public assembly: assist me to deal
faithfully with the souls of my people when conversing with them
in friendly intercourse, and when addressing them from thy holy
word.&nbsp; May I be instant in season and out of season for the
conversion of the irreligious, and for the comfort of those that
already believe.&nbsp; May the people committed to my charge be
preserved from every error in sentiment, and irregularity in
conduct, injurious to themselves and dishonourable to thee.&nbsp;
May many be added to the church, and may great prosperity attend
us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shouldst thou, in thy infinite wisdom, see <a
name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>fit to
afflict me in my own person, family, or friends, enable me to
meet the visitation with a full dependence on thy all-wise
providence, and with humble resignation to thy righteous
will.&nbsp; And shouldst thou call me from time into the eternal
world before the close of the present year, Oh may I die in the
faith of that gospel which I preach to perishing sinners, and in
the possession and enjoyment of that hope which I have
recommended to others, which has heaven for its glorious object,
and the atonement and intercession of thy Son Jesus Christ for
its firm foundation.&nbsp; Amen.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the autumn of 1810, Mr. Sloper spent some time at
Lowestoft, a distance from home, which allowed him the enjoyment
and advantage of the sea air, without seriously interfering with
the performance of his pastoral duties.&nbsp; There he became
acquainted with the celebrated Mrs. Siddons, who had escaped from
the excitement of public life, to the unmolested retirement and
invigorating breezes of the same watering-place.&nbsp; That
extraordinary woman had a <i>talent</i>, rather <a
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>than a
<i>taste</i>, for the vocation she pursued.&nbsp; Her natural
character was marked by extreme diffidence, and a
&ldquo;benignant singleness of mind.&rdquo;&nbsp; What was said
of her, could have been said, even in poetry, of few
actresses:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Behold, dividing still the palm of fame,<br
/>
Her radiant science, and her spotless life.&rdquo; <a
name="citation217a"></a><a href="#footnote217a"
class="citation">[217a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>She had already passed the zenith of her celebrity.&nbsp;
Providence had repeatedly and recently, called her to tread, in
domestic life, the &ldquo;path of sorrow,&rdquo; and her
religious advantages, however few, had taught her that</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<i>That</i>
path alone<br />
Leads to the land where sorrow is unknown.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Sweet sometimes,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;are the uses
of adversity.&nbsp; It not only strengthens family affection, but
teaches us all to walk humbly with our God.&rdquo; <a
name="citation217b"></a><a href="#footnote217b"
class="citation">[217b]</a>&nbsp; It is not surprising that she
was disposed to cultivate the society of those who <a
name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>could blend
piety with cheerfulness, and with whom she might be on friendly
terms without ceremony.&nbsp; Such acquaintances she found in Mr.
Sloper&rsquo;s family.&nbsp; Mrs. Siddons, with unassuming
kindness, contributed to their amusement by specimens of her
powerful reading.&nbsp; She joined willingly in the worship of
the family, and maintained the same invaluable practice at her
own lodgings.</p>
<p>Just at that time Mr. Sloper was requested to preach a sermon
to his own people, <a name="citation218"></a><a
href="#footnote218" class="citation">[218]</a> on an affecting
and mournful occasion&mdash;the death of a suicide.&nbsp; Though
he keenly felt the delicacy and difficulty of the task, a sense
of duty and the possibility of usefulness overcame his
scruples.&nbsp; He selected as his text, the impressive sentiment
of the apostle, &ldquo;<i>The sorrow of the world worketh
death</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;2 Cor. vii. 10.&nbsp; Mrs. Siddons was
one of his auditors.&nbsp; She who had been the honoured guest of
royalty, who had been enthroned as the Tragic Muse, and whose
voice had charmed applauding multitudes&mdash;was seen, in the
humble dissenting meeting-house at Beccles, <a
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>shedding
abundant and unaffected tears at the plain and faithful
exhibition of religious truth!</p>
<p>Mr. Sloper&rsquo;s preaching was as powerfully recommended to
her by the delightful illustration of christian principles,
exhibited in his private character, as by the intrinsic
importance of those principles and the simple gravity and
penetrating earnestness with which they were announced from his
lips.&nbsp; He afterwards procured for her, at her request, a
copy of Scott&rsquo;s admirable &ldquo;Commentary on the
Bible,&rdquo; which he accompanied with a letter, warmly urging
upon her attention the great realities her profession had so
manifest a tendency to exclude from her contemplations.</p>
<p>Mrs. Siddons more than once expressed her gratitude for the
interest Mr. Sloper had evinced in her eternal welfare; she
thanked him, in writing, for the advice he had given her, adding
an emphatic wish that &ldquo;God might enable her to follow
it&rdquo;&mdash;a wish which her pious and amiable correspondent
echoed with all the fervour of his heart.&nbsp; She returned into
the glare of popularity: but a hope may surely be indulged, that
the <a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>pressure of subsequent relative afflictions, and of old
age, were not permitted to come upon her, unaccompanied by the
impressions and consolations of true religion.&nbsp; Her elegant
biographer, Mr. Campbell, draws a veil over the state of her mind
during her last hours, which it would be deeply interesting to
penetrate.&nbsp; Would she not <i>then</i>, if reason were
undimmed, reflect upon the faithful counsel she received with
Scott&rsquo;s Bible, as being of infinitely greater value than
the applause of myriads or the fame of ages?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> dilapidated state of the
meeting-house, as well as its inadequacy to the accommodation of
increasing numbers, gave rise, in the year 1809, to the design of
erecting a more substantial and commodious place of
worship.&nbsp; This was accomplished in 1812, at an expense,
including the purchase of a small piece of ground, of &pound;2140
18<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>&nbsp; Besides a regular periodical
subscription, repeated efforts were made, by those who <a
name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>felt an
interest in the work, to liquidate this debt.&nbsp; It was not,
however, till 1829, that there appeared a balance in hand.&nbsp;
To a society who, as a body, could not boast of opulence, this
was naturally a subject of much pleasure.&nbsp; The pecuniary and
personal aid of their benevolent minister, had been rendered with
cheerfulness and alacrity; and he heartily sympathized with them
in the final accomplishment of their design.&nbsp; It was a fit
occasion for the exercise of the best social feelings.&nbsp;
Mutual congratulations were blended with ardent thankfulness to
God; and the account of the various donations and subscriptions
were closed with the following memorandum.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Be it remembered with gratitude to the
Giver of all good, that the debt of &pound;2140 18<i>s.</i>
4<i>d.</i>, contracted in the erection of the chapel, in the year
of our Lord 1812, after sixteen years&rsquo; persevering
exertion, was this year entirely discharged; in commemoration of
which, forty-four of the subscribers dined together at the
King&rsquo;s Head Inn, and in evidence of which the minister <a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>and deacons
have hereto subscribed their names, this 16th day of February,
1829.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>In the margin of the entry a reference is made to a passage of
Scripture, which indicates the character of the joy and the
proper object of the thankfulness thus manifested.&nbsp; 1 Chron.
xxix. 16, &ldquo;O Lord, our God, all this store that we have
prepared to build thee an house for thine holy name, cometh of
thy hand, and is all thine own.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>While the new chapel was building, this christian society was
deprived by death of a member whose character and usefulness, as
a man and as a Christian, are entitled to be recorded
here&mdash;<i>Mr. Daniel Delf</i>.&nbsp; He was favoured in early
life with the religious training of a pious mother, and the
public ministry of Mr. Bocking.&nbsp; Settling at <a
name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>Beccles, he
soon became a member of Mr. Heptinstall&rsquo;s church; and in
1792, on account of his excellent spirit and character, he was
chosen a deacon.&nbsp; In that office he exerted himself
continually to promote the peace and prosperity of the church,
and to strengthen the hands of his minister.&nbsp; Every member
found in him an example to stimulate, a friend to advise, and an
advocate before the throne of God.&nbsp; While his particular
attention was devoted to the &ldquo;household of faith,&rdquo; he
habitually laboured to do good unto all men, and was ever ready
to alleviate suffering humanity at the expense of
self-denial.&nbsp; Hence he was admired and respected by all who
knew him.&nbsp; Some who despised his piety, perceived the
benefits of it; and while they could ridicule the saint, revered
the man.&nbsp; Such an individual his friends could have wished
to retain for ever; but in the spring of 1812, repeated invasions
of disease warned them of the loss they were soon to
sustain.&nbsp; He went to Lowestoft, to try a change of air and
scene; but returned after a few weeks.&nbsp; Passing slowly near
the building he had been zealous to raise for God, <a
name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>he directed
his eye towards the work, and burst into tears.&nbsp; He wept
when he thought of the place of worship he should never enter,
and of the society he was about to leave: but he soon resumed his
fortitude, for he was in a few days to enter the glorious temple
of God, that &ldquo;house not made with hands, eternal in the
heavens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chamber of this dying saint exhibited a scene fraught with
instruction.&nbsp; Surrounded by relatives and friends in
unutterable anguish, <i>he</i> was serene, possessing &ldquo;the
peace of God which passeth understanding.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; said he to his sorrowing partner in life,
&ldquo;I shall not take <i>the promises</i> with me.&rdquo;&nbsp;
His medical attendant coming in shortly before he expired, he
said, &ldquo;If you can give me any thing whereby I may glorify
God more, do it.&rdquo;&nbsp; But nature was exhausted, and he
fell asleep in death.</p>
<p>A numerous congregation attentively heard his funeral sermon,
from Psal. xii. 1, &ldquo;Help, Lord; for the godly man ceaseth;
for the faithful fail from among the children of men.&rdquo; <a
name="citation225"></a><a href="#footnote225"
class="citation">[225]</a></p>
<p>His memory, is still cherished by all classes <a
name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 226</span>of his
neighbours with a vividness and a regard, which speak the justice
of the inscription compiled by his beloved pastor and placed upon
his grave.</p>

<p>Mr. Sloper had the happiness in 1814, to witness the formation
of the Beccles District Society in aid of Missions, which was
soon extended to <a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
227</span>the whole county of Suffolk.&nbsp; In September of that
year, a meeting of the neighbouring ministers was held at his
house, in consequence of some previous conversation on the
subject with two of his brethren in a friendly visit.&nbsp; His
whole soul entered into the cause of missions; and when the
county society was formed, every eye was directed towards him as
the proper person to act as its secretary, an office which he
filled with great wisdom and unabated zeal, till his last and
long-continued affliction compelled him to relinquish all active
service.&nbsp; The days of the missionary meetings were among the
most happy of his life; and never was he absent, except when
sickness compelled that absence.</p>
<p>About this time, also, he began to take a very active part in
all the meetings of the Bible Society within twelve or fourteen
miles of his residence.&nbsp; His great love to the holy
Scriptures, and consequently to all the means of disseminating
them, rendered him a willing helper.&nbsp; Probably no individual
in the county of Suffolk attended more of the meetings of the
Society.&nbsp; And though at those meetings he always took a
leading part, yet <a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
228</span>none could accuse him of a forwardness disgraceful to
him that manifests it, and injurious to the cause which he
professes to serve.</p>
<p>Indeed, the excellent pastor of the Congregational church at
Beccles, was so highly and so universally respected and beloved
by his brethren in the ministry, and by the members of
neighbouring churches, that there were few occasions of interest
to them on which his presence and assistance were not
sought.&nbsp; They felt that in him they could present to the
most numerous and mixed assemblies, a picture of the judicious,
faithful, practical christian minister, which the heavenly-minded
would admire, and which the profane would find it impossible to
despise.&nbsp; He was the counterpart of Cowper&rsquo;s
&ldquo;pastor,&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Simple,
grave, sincere;<br />
In doctrine uncorrupt; in language plain,<br />
And plain in manner; decent, solemn, chaste,<br />
And natural in gesture; much impress&rsquo;d<br />
Himself, as conscious of his awful charge,<br />
And anxious mainly that the flock he feeds<br />
May feel it too: affectionate in look,<br />
And tender in address, as well became<br />
A messenger of grace to guilty men.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>It
would be difficult, and is unnecessary, to enumerate all the
instances in which Mr. Sloper was engaged at ordinations, at the
opening of places of worship, and in the service of societies
formed for promoting the interests of the Redeemer&rsquo;s
kingdom.</p>
<p>On the 23rd April, 1816, he delivered at Needham Market,
before the half-yearly association of the Suffolk Independent
churches, a discourse, which he published at their request, and
which speedily went into a second edition.&nbsp; It is founded on
1 Thess. ii. 19, 20, &ldquo;For what is our hope, or joy, or
crown of rejoicing? are not even ye, in the presence of our Lord
Jesus Christ at his coming?&nbsp; For ye are our glory and
joy.&rdquo;&nbsp; This sermon affords a specimen of that sober
evenness of style, supported by solidity of sentiment, and
adorned by dignified yet affectionate earnestness, which
characterized Mr. Sloper&rsquo;s pulpit exercises.&nbsp; He
points out in what respects christian churches are the glory and
joy of their ministers; and urges a devout regard to the objects
of their union.&nbsp; The following passage, with which he closes
his discussion of the former of <a name="page230"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 230</span>these topics, will at once
illustrate his manner of preaching, and the value he attached to
the intercessions of his people.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Christian affection, my brethren, sweetens
the intercourse of life; it is the comfort of the church on
earth, and the element of the church in heaven; and in the
exercise of this celestial virtue, you will promote each
other&rsquo;s welfare, and fill your pastors&rsquo; hearts with
gratitude and joy; you will receive their admonitions with
meekness, listen to their instructions with a proper temper,
cover their infirmities and not expose them, and be ready by your
words and actions to strengthen their hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ministers are greatly encouraged by the pious and
constant prayers of their people.&nbsp; Ah! my friends, we need
your prayers: we are frail creatures, and men of like passions
with yourselves.&nbsp; Whatever be our feelings, we must perform
the solemn duties of our office.&nbsp; Our work is arduous; our
responsibility awful; and even an apostle says, &lsquo;Brethren,
pray for us;&rsquo; and <i>we</i>, you may rest assured, cannot
dispense with your supplications, or be happy without them.&nbsp;
We are relieved, <a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
231</span>in all our labours and afflictions, by the persuasion
that the people of our care are a godly and praying people.&nbsp;
How refreshing is the thought, that while we are studying the
Scriptures, and preparing for the exercises of the sabbath, our
christian friends are imploring the aid of God&rsquo;s grace and
Spirit, to preserve us from error, and to render us faithful to
the solemn trust assigned us!&nbsp; With what pleasure do we
enter the pulpit, when we can believe that our hearers have been
praying for a blessing on our souls, and on the labours of our
ministry!&nbsp; We are animated to proceed in our exertions, when
the hearts of our friends ascend in supplication to God, that the
word of his grace may be applied with power to their own minds,
and be the means of leading others to the Saviour and to the
kingdom of heaven.&nbsp; If you come to the house of God with a
devotional spirit, and bear your ministers and their great work
upon your hearts, it is more than probable that a disposition to
cavil and to censure will be destroyed, and as new-born babes,
you will &ldquo;receive the sincere milk of the word, that ye may
grow thereby;&rdquo; <a name="page232"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 232</span>while, in a sense that rises in
importance with the progress of time, you will be the &lsquo;joy
and crown of rejoicing,&rsquo; of those who have taken the
oversight among you in the Lord . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are true Christians, and firmly hold the sublime
and holy doctrines of the gospel of Christ; if you improve under
the ministry of the word, and bear the fruits of righteousness,
to the honour of divine grace; if the important duties of social
religion be conscientiously and steadily performed; if your
desires, prayers, and efforts are employed for the comfort,
encouragement, and success of your ministers; and if all your
conduct as Christians and members of churches, be directed to the
glory of the great Head of the church; you are indeed most
honourable societies; you are a credit to your profession, the
&lsquo;hope&rsquo; of your pastors, and will meet them as their
&lsquo;joy and crown of rejoicing&rsquo; at the resurrection of
the just.&rdquo; <a name="citation232"></a><a href="#footnote232"
class="citation">[232]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A society of a private nature for friendly intercourse among a
few neighbouring ministers, <a name="page233"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 233</span>was formed at Mr. Sloper&rsquo;s
house in 1822.&nbsp; The occasional interchange of counsel and
sympathy thus secured, afforded him much unmingled satisfaction;
and even during his last illness he joined in one of these
meetings, and prayed with great fervency and affection.</p>
<p>In 1824 Mr. Sloper published an account of Samuel Markham
Archer, a little boy who died at Beccles, May 1st, in that
year.&nbsp; It is an interesting narrative, beautifully
illustrating the power and value of religion operating upon the
mind of a child.&nbsp; This tract reached a third edition, and
was stereotyped in the following year.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1825, Mr. Sloper was again the subject of
severe affliction, and for several Lord&rsquo;s days his people
were deprived of his public services.&nbsp; It was his great
anxiety that they might continue to be fed with the bread of
life.&nbsp; His brethren in the ministry readily lent their aid;
and on the first sabbath in May he was again permitted to unite
with his flock in sweet communion at the table of the Lord.</p>
<p>For several subsequent years he continued to labour with much
acceptance, and to enjoy the <a name="page234"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 234</span>unmingled respect and affection due
to a truly upright, holy, and amiable deportment.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1832, the awful ravages of the cholera
occasioned special meetings for prayer, in almost all christian
societies.&nbsp; At the suggestion of Mr. Sloper, such a meeting
was held at the Independent chapel, Beccles, on the evening of
Wednesday, September 5th.&nbsp; It was numerously attended.&nbsp;
A solemnity equally free from formality and enthusiasm prevailed
in the assembly and characterized the service.&nbsp; Several
leading members of the church prayed appropriately and
fervently.&nbsp; The psalms selected for singing, were suited to
the particular occasion, and were afterwards remembered with a
sad impression of their almost prophetic strain, with reference
to the mysterious event which was about to be disclosed in the
providence of God.&nbsp; The faithful and beloved pastor himself
read, from the pulpit he had so long occupied,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Death, like an overflowing stream,<br />
Sweeps us away; our life&rsquo;s a dream,<br />
An empty tale, a morning flower,<br />
Cut down, and wither&rsquo;d in an hour!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>He
delivered an address, pointing out the peculiar propriety of
prayer under the circumstances of that affecting period; and with
solemn supplication and the apostolic benediction closed the
service.&nbsp; While the congregation were withdrawing he was
observed in the act of descending with extreme difficulty from
the pulpit.&nbsp; It had pleased the Sovereign Disposer of all
events to afflict him with paralysis, so severely, that the most
painful apprehensions were felt as to the result.</p>
<p>Such an occurrence, under these circumstances, was singularly
affecting.&nbsp; Mr. Sloper had entertained a presentiment that
his labours would not be extended to a much longer period than
those of his immediate predecessor.&nbsp; On the sabbath which
completed the twenty-ninth year of his pastorate, his mind had
been much occupied with this apprehension; and though he knew in
whose hands his &ldquo;times&rdquo; were, it was not till he had
made one unsuccessful effort that he could so far overcome his
feelings as to commence his public address in the afternoon of
that day.&nbsp; It was now perceived that his fears were about to
be realized.&nbsp; <a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
236</span>But the juncture had arrived at which a faithful
minister might well receive with humble thankfulness and patient
acquiescence, the summons to his great account.&nbsp; He was
&ldquo;found&rdquo; in the exercise of watchfulness, and in the
very act of prayer, labouring &ldquo;out of season&rdquo; to
render the judgments of God subservient to the best interests of
his flock, with his &ldquo;loins girt about, and his lamp
burning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This event excited the deepest interest and sympathy, not only
in the congregation, but throughout the town and
neighbourhood.&nbsp; Special prayer-meetings to implore the
divine mercy in the restoration of the smitten shepherd, and the
influence of the Holy Spirit to direct the church in their
critical affairs, were held; and temporary measures were resorted
to for supplying the pulpit.</p>
<p>For about two months the congregation availed itself of the
services of Mr. Russ, who had just then terminated an engagement
at Gorleston.&nbsp; From the middle of November 1832, to the
beginning of the subsequent July, the Rev. Thomas Morell, jun.
(nephew of the eminent <a name="page237"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 237</span>principal of Coward College,
London,) laboured here.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1833, Mr. Sloper&rsquo;s indisposition was so
far alleviated, that he was enabled, in the seclusion of his own
house, to employ his mind upon topics and objects still dear to
him.&nbsp; He had always been accustomed, as secretary of the
Suffolk Society in aid of Missions, to prepare its Report.&nbsp;
The annual meeting drew near; and he felt his incapacity for the
wonted task.&nbsp; But he wrote, at intervals, a letter to the
treasurer, Mr. Shepherd Bay, which was read at the meeting, and
printed in lieu of the sixteenth Report of the Society.&nbsp;
Never had he furnished a report which was heard with deeper
interest.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><i>Beccles</i>,
<i>April</i> 26, 1833.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Friend,</p>
<p>The approaching anniversary of the Suffolk Society in aid of
Missions, awakens feelings of no ordinary character in my
mind.&nbsp; Gladly should I, as on many former occasions, meet
you in the performance of official duties, and in the enjoyment
of some of the highest privileges <a name="page238"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 238</span>of the Christian, had not the
all-wise providence of God incapacitated me for meeting my
brethren and friends, except at a throne of grace, where,
notwithstanding the distance of forty miles, we can cherish the
same feelings of benevolence towards the perishing heathen, and
exercise christian love one towards another . . . Gratefully I
desire to acknowledge the kindness of my dear brethren and
friends, personally shown to me as their secretary during past
years, and especially their kind letters of condolence and
fervent prayers since my affliction, which has made me the
Lord&rsquo;s prisoner for nearly eight months.&nbsp; I rejoice in
their personal and relative peace and prosperity; and with you,
my friend, do I share in the satisfaction that our county Society
exhibits pleasing signs of christian union and hopeful
efficiency, and that the desire of our hearts, as its sincerely
devoted servants, promises to be increasingly and ultimately
accomplished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust this anniversary will be distinguished by every
thing that increases the dignity of the christian character; that
promotes the cause of social religion at home; that gives a holy
impulse <a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
239</span>to the soul in seeking the prosperity of our churches,
the best interests of our country, and the extension of the
Redeemer&rsquo;s kingdom throughout every part of the habitable
world.&nbsp; May the great Head of the church pour out his Holy
Spirit on your assembly!&mdash;that the young may be enlisted
into the blessed service in which the fathers of many have been
so honourably and happily employed; that christian zeal may be
reanimated; that devotion and liberality may be abundantly
increased; and that the coming year may be rendered the most
prosperous and encouraging of all that have passed away since the
formation of the Society within the venerable walls where you
will, on Tuesday, be assembled.</p>
<p>. . . . . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Continue, my dear friend, to pray for me; and the same
request I would make to all who may meet you in the sanctuary on
the delightful occasion, that the awful dispensation with which I
have been visited may be sanctified to me and to all with whom I
am connected: and should the Father of mercies realize my hopes
of ultimate recovery, I trust the cause of the blessed <a
name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>Saviour
will continue to lie near my heart, and that I shall renew my
humble efforts with you to advance, as God&rsquo;s honoured
instruments, the best interests of the Suffolk Society in aid of
Missions.&nbsp; To be, for years to come, your fellow-labourer in
the service of our Association, will continue to be one of the
chief enjoyments of my pilgrimage; and to die an undisgraced
servant in the cause which the Society was formed to promote,
will contribute to comfort my departing spirit when, from scenes
of duty and means of grace, I shall pass to my final account, and
return no more for my own advantage, or that of my fellow-men
upon earth.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">I am, my dear friend,<br />
Yours with sincere affection,<br />
and best wishes,<br />
<span class="smcap">Isaac Sloper</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>About two months after the above letter was written, Mr.
Sloper had a second attack of so serious a description, as to
preclude all hope of his ever again returning even to the partial
discharge of his pastoral duties.</p>
<p><a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 241</span>An
application was consequently made to the directors of Highbury
College for further supplies, and on September 15th, 1833, <span
class="smcap">Mr. John Flower</span>, jun. first officiated at
Beccles.&nbsp; He had come down as a supply for a month only; but
that time had not expired before all hearts seemed to be united
in his favour.&nbsp; A special prayer-meeting was held, the
afflicted pastor of the church consulted, his approval decidedly
expressed, and on October 13th Mr. Flower was invited to take the
oversight of this people.&nbsp; The church expressed their humble
hope that as they had sought divine direction, the result would
be their own growth in holiness, the conversion of many sinners
unto God, and the enlarged manifestation of the divine
glory.&nbsp; Mr. Flower accepted the invitation, proposing, as he
had not completed his studies in the college, the last sabbath in
the following February for the commencement of his pastoral
duties.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the public services of the congregation continued to
be conducted by a variety of ministers.</p>
<p><a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>Prior
to Mr. Flower&rsquo;s entering upon his office, Mr. Sloper sent
in his written resignation in the following humble and
affectionate terms:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<i>Beccles</i>,
<i>Feb.</i> 13<i>th</i>, 1834.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear friends,</p>
<p>After labouring among you for upwards of thirty years, I am
brought to the painful necessity of resigning my connexion with
you as your minister and pastor.&nbsp; I resign with humility,
acknowledging my unworthiness, and craving the mercy of our Lord
Jesus at his second coming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I have offended any of our friends I ask their
forgiveness, and commend them all to the divine mercy of our Lord
Jesus Christ unto life eternal.&nbsp; It is a comfort to me that,
while I feel imperiously required by my imperfections to resign
my pastoral relation, I can commend to you my dear friend and
brother Flower, to take the oversight of you in the Lord: and
this I do with sincere affection, and with earnest prayer that
the divine blessing may remain with you for ever.</p>
<p><a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
243</span>&ldquo;Begging my affectionate regards to all classes
of my friends&mdash;to the aged, the poor, and the young&mdash;I

regard,<br />
and most earnest prayers,<br />
<span class="smcap">Isaac Sloper</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To <span class="smcap">Mr. John Crisp</span>,<br />
and the other Deacons, &amp;c. &amp;c.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The best testimony to Mr. Sloper&rsquo;s ministerial character
and exertions, is the <i>effect</i> of his devoted
services.&nbsp; It is sufficient to point to a church remarkable
for its numbers&mdash;to a congregation constant and attentive,
and comprising many who had not formally joined the church, but
were the friends of Christ&mdash;and to prayer-meetings, and
other week-day services, regularly and well attended:&mdash;a
minister of the gospel needs no other commendation.</p>
<p>Some intimations of Mr. Sloper&rsquo;s personal character have
appeared in the previous pages.&nbsp; It was formed from an
assemblage of those attractive and useful, though unobtrusive,
qualities, which are not the best adapted for elaborate
description, but are peculiarly conducive to the <a
name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
244</span>respectability of the individual and the happiness of
society.&nbsp; His predominant quality was <i>benevolence</i>,
ennobled and directed by deep and abiding piety.&nbsp; With him
it was not a sickly sentimentalism exhausted upon objects of no
moment, nor a heated enthusiasm aiming at projects of
extravagance; but a principle which could expand to the great
interests of humanity, or contract itself to the minute charities
of domestic life.&nbsp; It guided his energies to the work of
evangelizing heathen millions, and pervaded his ordinary
intercourse with friends and neighbours.&nbsp; Those who
occasionally saw him were struck with the urbanity of his
manners; those who were favoured with his intimate friendship
knew that his heart was all kindness.&nbsp; He rejoiced with
those that rejoiced, and wept with those that wept.&nbsp; Much of
his happiness consisted in making others happy.&nbsp; Once
speaking of a servant visiting her friends, he observed with true
generosity, &ldquo;It is right she should go; she has the same
feelings with ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one was more free from the unamiable passions.&nbsp;
Although he never deemed it necessary <a name="page245"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 245</span>to merge the citizen in the saint,
or forgot how inseparably blended are the interests of civil and
religious liberty, he was unstained by political animosity.&nbsp;
The avowal of his opinions was never unaccompanied by candour and
charity towards those who differed from him.&nbsp; By his
explanatory and conciliatory addresses on various suitable
occasions, there is reason to believe that he contributed in no
slight degree to prepare the minds of those within the circle of
his influence, for the more cordial reception of the great
legislative changes of which he lived to witness the
consummation.</p>
<p>If ever he was betrayed into a warm expression, he was
remarkably candid and placable: once convinced that he was wrong,
he <i>made haste</i> with kindness and compunction in his heart,
and frankness on his tongue, to repair the momentary error.&nbsp;
Nor was he less ready to forgive.&nbsp; Some years ago a
vexatious injury was committed in his garden.&nbsp; He remarked
respecting it, &ldquo;I wish the man a better heart.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It is in matters of such comparatively trivial importance that
character exhibits its true features.</p>
<p><a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>Even
when affliction had partially obscured his mental powers, and his
faith and patience were called into constant exercise, the holy
love of the Christian still burst through the cloud, and
irradiated the long evening of his pilgrimage.</p>
<p>It is not to be wondered at that he was greatly beloved, not
only by his immediate friends, but by persons of all ages,
classes, and callings, wherever he was known.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was
present,&rdquo; says one of his most esteemed brethren in the
ministry, &ldquo;at his ordination; I was present at his
interment; I enjoyed a large share of his friendship in the long
interval between the two events; and I never witnessed his
approach without gladness, or parted from him without
regret.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Mr. Flower&rsquo;s ordination took place June 5th, 1834.&nbsp;
The Rev. Wm. Ward, of Stowmarket, delivered the introductory
discourse, on the scriptural character of a christian
church.&nbsp; The usual questions to the deacons and the new
minister were put by the Rev. John Dennant, of Halesworth.&nbsp;
Prayer was offered by the Rev. Andrew Ritchie, of Wrentham; and
the charge to Mr. <a name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
247</span>Flower was given by his father, the Rev. John Flower,
of Titchfield, Hants.&nbsp; On the evening of the day, the Rev.
John Alexander, of Norwich, addressed to the church and
congregation an affectionate and excellent discourse.</p>
<p>About five weeks after the above event, Mr. Flower was visited
with a painful and alarming affliction, which laid him aside from
his public duties until the 7th June following.</p>
<p>During those months, the public services of the congregation
were conducted by a succession of ministers.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>On the 23rd November, 1835, Mr. Sloper&rsquo;s protracted
affliction was terminated by death.&nbsp; Although he had been
long lost to society, the event was a subject of general and
sincere lamentation.&nbsp; The chapel was thronged with those who
came to witness his interment at the foot of the pulpit from
which he had dispensed the words of eternal life.</p>
<p>His death was improved on the following Lord&rsquo;s-day
afternoon, by Mr. Creak, of Yarmouth, from 2 Pet. i.
12&ndash;15.&nbsp; The young people <a name="page248"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 248</span>of the congregation have since
gratified their feelings of veneration for one who ever
manifested the tenderest regard for their best interests, by
placing in the meeting-house a neat marble tablet, with the
following inscription:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span

<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Blessed is that servant whom
his Lord, when<br />
he cometh, shall find so doing.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These records ought not to be closed without a brief reference
to the truly honourable life and peaceful death of <i>Mr. William
Crisp</i>.</p>
<p><a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>He
became a member of this church on the 4th June, 1802, and was
some years afterwards chosen a deacon.&nbsp; In both relations,
he acted with uniform candour, kindness, meekness, and
generosity.&nbsp; He was a liberal pecuniary contributor to the
support of the cause; the friend of minister and people, and the
benefactor of the poor.</p>
<p>He sustained, as a merchant, a reputation against which
slander never ventured to direct a shaft; and his whole
deportment imparted, in the eye of the world, a weight and
dignity to the christian community to which he belonged.&nbsp;
The declaration of holy writ was manifestly verified in reference
to him: &ldquo;The just man walketh in his integrity: his
children are blessed after him,&rdquo; Prov. xx. 7.&nbsp; He
lived to witness the departure into the eternal world, of five of
his children, who all died in the faith and hope of the
gospel.&nbsp; Two only survive&mdash;they have risen up to
&ldquo;call him blessed,&rdquo; and one of them fills an
important station in the Baptist Academy at Bristol.</p>
<p><a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 250</span>Mr.
Crisp died on the 18th January, 1836, in the 80th year of his
age. <a name="citation250"></a><a href="#footnote250"
class="citation">[250]</a></p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>After Mr. Flower&rsquo;s restoration to health, an increasing
eagerness to hear the gospel was manifested, and the duty of
providing additional accommodation in the chapel became a subject
of serious consideration.&nbsp; Early in the last year (1836) an
extensive alteration and enlargement was determined upon; the
greater part of the requisite funds were furnished by the
cheerful contributions of many, and the very liberal assistance
of some; and the work has since been accomplished.&nbsp; A sketch
of the building in its improved form is prefixed to this little
volume.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The expense of erecting and enlarging places of worship is far
more serious to dissenters than <a name="page251"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 251</span>to members of the Established
Church, since independently of receiving no direct aid from
government, the former are subject to the duty upon the materials
used, from which burden the latter are exempt.&nbsp; Nearly
allied to this tax upon nonconformity, are the stamp duties upon
the conveyances, and deeds for renewing trusts, of chapels, and
the charges for enrolment.</p>
<p>These form a heavy item in the balance of justice which
remains due to the dissenting portion of the community, or
rather, to the interests of religion itself.&nbsp; Its
liquidation is not demanded merely as an act of justice; but as a
step towards the total disenthralment of Christianity from the
paralyzing grasp of state patronage.&nbsp; The religious world,
taught by principle and by example, is discovering that it must
look to the voluntary efforts of benevolence, impelled by
christian principles and crowned with the divine blessing, for
the evangelization of the people.</p>
<p>For a long period after the revolution, the nonconformists,
bleeding with the persecution of ages, sank into a premature and
too protracted <a name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
252</span>slumber.&nbsp; But they have gradually aroused
themselves, and are engaging in the assertion of their rights
with increasing vigour.&nbsp; Nor will their claims cease to be
reiterated, till in the affairs of the soul, &ldquo;<span
class="GutSmall">ABSOLUTE LIBERTY, JUST AND TRUE LIBERTY, EQUAL
AND IMPARTIAL LIBERTY</span>,&rdquo; shall have become the
possession of every British subject.</p>

charged with holding was this, &ldquo;It is blasphemy to call any

the obedience of the same: and of such lawgivers there is but
one.&nbsp; James iv. 18.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Archbishop

<p>&ldquo;Christians are forbidden to look up to any man as
having dominion over their faith, as entitled to implicit
credence and submission, or, as the head of their sect whose
decisions were stamped with authority over their consciences;
they were to oppose all claims and pretensions of this kind by
whomsoever they were advanced or on whatever
grounds.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Rev. T. Scott</i>, <i>late Rector of

</blockquote>
<p>It is equally difficult to reconcile a hearty belief in the
twentieth article of the Church of England with these sentiments,
and to distinguish them in substance from the following:
&ldquo;Authoritative and legislative interference apart from him,
we dare not recognise: our loyalty to Christ as the
church&rsquo;s only head, compels us to disclaim it, and to
protest against all human dictation.&nbsp; It cannot be shown
that he has any where delegated his sovereignty; that he has
appointed any order of men to act for him in a vice-regal
capacity, and invested them with irresponsible and discretionary
powers, or indeed with any powers at all, to frame articles of
belief and formularies of worship and discipline, to fix the
meaning of his word, or to devise and prescribe the religion of a
congregation, or community, or province, or
nation.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Scales&rsquo; Principles of Dissent</i>,

<p><a name="footnote10"></a><a href="#citation10"
class="footnote">[10]</a> There is abundant evidence that the
christian sects properly called with reference to their church
government, Independents, are entitled to this honourable
distinction.&nbsp; The Rev. Thomas Adkins in his recently
published Records of the Independent Church at Southampton, (a
book more especially valuable for its argumentative and
explanatory observations,) has collected several testimonies in
support of the statement that &ldquo;The Independents were the
first as a sect, in this country, to discover and to recognise,
to their full extent, the sacred rights of conscience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The editor of Col. Hutchinson&rsquo;s Memoirs, (a clergyman of
the Established Church,) says, they &ldquo;proceeded upon that
principle which, how general soever it ought to be, is, however,
unfortunately very uncommon, of allowing to all that liberty of
conscience they demanded for
themselves.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Introd.</i> p. 17.</p>
<p>Mr. Brodie, the learned author of the History of the British
Empire from the accession of Charles I. to the Restoration,
remarks that &ldquo;The grand principle by which the Independents
surpassed all other sects was, universal toleration to all
denominations of christians whose religion was not conceived to
be hostile to the peace of the state, a principle to which they
were faithful in the height of power as well as under
persecution.&rdquo;&mdash;Vol. iii. p. 517.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;By the Independent divines, who were his
instructors, (says the noble biographer of Locke,) our
philosopher was taught those principles of religious liberty
which they were the first to disclose to the
world.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Lord King&rsquo;s Life of Locke</i>, 4to
ed. p. 178.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the motion for inquiring into the cause of the death of the
missionary Smith, Lord Brougham is reported to have said,
&ldquo;Mr. Smith was a pious and faithful minister of the
Independents, that body, much to be respected indeed for their
numbers, but far more to be held in lasting veneration for their
unshaken fortitude, with which, in all times, they have
maintained their attachment to civil and religious liberty, and

descriptive of the spot, while the marshes which lie west, north,

if prudence had permitted, they would have done so at an earlier
period, without any scruple as to the lawfulness of such a
proceeding.&nbsp; They had, indeed, as Mr. Harmer suggests,
&ldquo;this to plead for themselves, among other things, that
they entered not actually into these associations till the whole
legal frame of the episcopal church was dissolved by the
extinction of monarchy, and men left to follow their own light in
these matters by the then public authority.&rdquo;&nbsp; But to
attach any importance to such an argument, would betray the
advocate of religious liberty into a surrender of his great
principle,&mdash;a principle clearly stated in a quotation
occurring in connexion with the above language: &ldquo;As freedom
is the birthright of mankind, any number of persons may
voluntarily unite themselves for such purposes, and under such
regulations, as appear useful and convenient to them, provided
they do not encroach on the rules of justice, and the rights of
others.&nbsp; And if they may unite for other purposes, much more
may they unite for the purposes of religion, and the service of
their common Lord and Master.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Harmer&rsquo;s

16.&nbsp; It will be remembered that the Corporation Act had not
yet stigmatized, as unworthy of being intrusted with civil power,
all who could not conform to the legislative creed, or consent to
prove themselves unworthy, by desecrating the most solemn
ordinance of religion to the unscriptural and unholy purpose of
qualification for office.&nbsp; Dissenters have been relieved
from this grievance, but it is deemed necessary still to require,
on their acceptance of municipal offices, a solemn declaration
against using the influence they may possess <i>by virtue</i> of
these offices, to the injury of the established church.&nbsp;
This is one of the &ldquo;acknowledgments&rdquo; which dissenters
are still obliged to render to the dominant church; objectionable
enough to be felt, by many of them, as a legislative insult and a
bitter grievance; but forming indeed a poor protection to the
establishment, since every dissenter may, nevertheless, use his
<i>extra-official</i> influence to bring about that great
renovation and extended usefulness of the episcopal sect, which
will result from a dissolution of its alliance with the
state.</p>

to consider Mr. Ottee as the pastor chosen in 1653, by mistaking
the year in which he was said to be &ldquo;made pastor,&rdquo;
which is certainly 1656.&nbsp; Mr. Harmer says, &ldquo;July 29,
1653, Mr. Robert Ottee was chosen their pastor, and ordained Nov.

Mr. Ottee is stated, in the dedication prefixed to his posthumous
Sermons, to have been minister of this congregation &ldquo;for

expression, if he had been thirty-<i>two</i>, than if he had been
thirty-<i>five</i> years pastor; and he died in 1689.</p>

mistake than to suppose that at the period referred to above, the
Presbyterian dissenters alone couched their trust deeds in
general terms; unless it be the strange notion that the absence
of doctrinal restrictions implied indifference as to religious
sentiments.&nbsp; The present is one instance of many in which a
Congregational place of worship was settled in that manner, under
a minister whose sermons betray no symptoms of such an
indifference.&nbsp; Equally unfounded, and more unkind, is the
imputation of intolerance cast upon the modern Independents, on
account of the restrictions by which experience has taught them
to protect property <i>they devote</i> to a specific object, from
being diverted into other channels.&nbsp; In order to sustain so
serious a charge it should be shown, not merely that the
Independents attach the highest importance to the possession of
scriptural views on the doctrines of Christianity, and that they
take care not to allow their chapels to be held by those whose
opinions <i>they</i> disbelieve, and even regard as dangerous;
but that they desire to employ some degree or kind of coercion to
induce others to profess their opinions and to worship in their
temples.&nbsp; The truth is, that the importance attached by the
Independents to certain doctrines, imparts a more honourable
character to <i>their</i> advocacy of religious liberty, than can
belong to those who deem religious opinions of minor if not of
trivial moment.&nbsp; The writer has been induced to advert to
these topics in consequence of a remark on the subject of
Presbyterian practices, in an interesting work, written by one
whom he well knows to be incapable of wilful misrepresentation,
or even of an unkind feeling towards any denomination of
Christians.&nbsp; <i>See Murch&rsquo;s History of the

church book to have been given by &ldquo;the reverend elders,

occasionally held in the earliest times of the Congregational
churches, in Norfolk and Suffolk.&nbsp; At a later period,
<i>stated</i> meetings were held by the ministers of the Walpole,
Wrentham, and Southwold churches, who were, by degrees, joined by
others of their brethren.&nbsp; Dr. Doddridge, in 1741, dedicated
a sermon (preached at Kettering) to the associated ministers of
Norfolk and Suffolk, with expressions of great affection and
respect.&nbsp; In 1761, these meetings, which, (as Mr. Harmer
remarks,) &ldquo;agreeably to the usual course of human
affairs,&rdquo; had been attended with diminished zeal, were
revived on an extended scale, and continued to be held twice a
year, for some years afterwards.&nbsp; Those who attended them,
claimed no &ldquo;authoritative power, but merely a reverential
regard to counsels, given in the gentlest
way.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Harmer&rsquo;s Misc. Works</i>, pp.

the Baptist church of Rushall, which is said to have been as
ancient as the protectorate.&nbsp; About 1730 a Mr. Miller was
its pastor.&nbsp; He subsequently removed to Norwich, and was
succeeded by Mr. Milliot.&nbsp; Towards the close of his life
they chose a Mr. Simons, the benefit of whose ministry the
Baptists of Beccles were also desirous of enjoying.&nbsp; For
their accommodation the seat of the church was removed to
Beccles, and there Mr. Simons resided till his death.&nbsp; After
that event the interest at Beccles declined.&nbsp; It was broken
up about 1766, and the members residing in or near Beccles
re-united with the Independents there and with the congregation

to the Baptist church at Claxton, in Norfolk, under the pastoral
oversight of Mr. Job Hupton; but the inconvenience of attending
public worship at so great a distance, induced them to obtain the
use of a building in Beccles.&nbsp; The place they procured had
been occasionally used for devotional purposes, and the
celebrated John Wesley had once preached there; but it was
sometimes appropriated to the barbarous amusement of
cock-fighting.&nbsp; This circumstance was very repugnant to the
feelings of those who resorted thither for religious purposes,
and it stimulated their efforts to provide a house of prayer of
their own.&nbsp; In 1805, the present Baptist meeting-house was
erected.&nbsp; On the 5th Sept. 1808, a church was formed
consisting of twenty-four persons; and, on the 12th July, 1809,
Mr. Tipple, late of Hail-Weston, Hunts. was publicly recognized
as their pastor.&nbsp; He resigned his pastorship in the
following year, and from that period the church and congregation
were supplied by a succession of ministers, without pastoral
settlement, till 1822, when the Rev. George Wright commenced his
labours.&nbsp; On the 19th July, 1823, he was set apart to the
pastoral office, which he now ably and usefully sustains.&nbsp;
The church comprises, at the present time, nearly 150
members.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
